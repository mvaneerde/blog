1
00:00:00,717 --> 00:00:02,177
We'll play a little more.

2
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:14,623
Level three! I have
increased my level by 50%!

3
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:22,976
Uh-oh! We're tangling against a level
four! We're punching above our weight!

4
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:24,541
What are we gonna do?

5
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:29,005
I start with a Melmetal;
he starts with a Dragonite.

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,730
Oh, good: Electric is
good against Flying.

7
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:33,960
Superpower move.

8
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:38,640
I probably should have held onto this
move a little, because now it's obvious

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,767
that it's a very fast move, and
he's probably going to NOT shield.

10
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,605
Yeah, yeah. Um;

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,245
so I'm just gonna
farm some energy here,

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,010
and then I'll switch
over to Garchomp.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,030
Ehh... let's not shield yet.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,530
Let's see what he's
got. Outrage? Okay.

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,200
So yeah that
resources outrage here.

16
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:06,781
This is actually sort
of done my my doing a

17
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:07,962
and vs trade.

18
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:14,407
Now he will definitely shoe.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,220
Because he knows I switched.

20
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,760
All he didn't you.

21
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,870
Know.

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:21,610
Oh dear.

23
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:24,030
Me too okay.

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,730
He hasn't shielded at all yet.

25
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,960
That's odd.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,440
She just not shielding

27
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,280
cause

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,721
he's definitely issue here and

29
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,810
yeah okay.

30
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,150
And I'm going to show here.

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,480
Cause I want

32
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:47,533
to.

33
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:51,630
Want to save enough of that
energy to do another charge me.

34
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
The couldn't get enough.

35
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:58,410
Yeah

36
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:58,890
yeah

37
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,010
seriously.

38
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,090
Gonna die anyway.

39
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,120
Let's hope that he
doesn't shield this time.

40
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:08,970
Does.

41
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:09,630
That's.

42
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,260
God

43
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:10,740
okay

44
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
but.

45
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,550
Get not that.

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,320
Let's go back and

47
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,440
do.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This.

49
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,316
Definitely gonna to

50
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:26,548
here.

51
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,291
Come with the sealed
that church from of here

52
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,490
and I think I have enough.

53
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,420
HP left to

54
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,570
pull it off.

55
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,610
How does shields and your debt.

56
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,030
Now we got one
pokemon left he said

57
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,540
really.

58
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,870
Can do to steel.

59
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:52,557
I do the steel I think
I can get the still

60
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,590
gegen.

61
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:55,620
The steelers to steal.

62
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,560
Then I ended up a ferry
or psychic puts any cause.

63
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Nothing really ugh

64
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,070
why did I do the steal idiot.

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,280
Why.

66
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:13,828
Prior using your charge me.

67
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Why.

68
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,390
That's such a waste of

69
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,540
damage.

70
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,230
Okay this is a bad
matchup peace movement.

71
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,440
Yeah.

72
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,110
I lose.

73
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:37,650
Earthquake

74
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,070
nope

75
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,230
that's not very effective.

76
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,631
That's the only
have one children.

77
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,390
Yeah and I wouldn't it.

78
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,140
Alright not very effective
wins against super effective.

79
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,052
And this is why you don't use your
charge move when the other guy.

80
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:04,385
Was debt.

81
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:08,280
Said that church move.

82
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,180
For the expo.

83
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,700
Although to be fair I
was about to do with

84
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:14,830
them with going to.

85
00:04:20,498 --> 00:04:22,200
Completely unearned
victory there.

86
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:24,750
Against

87
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,930
the higher though.

88
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:31,743
It'll get over one.

89
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Are there.

90
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,310
The email notification.

91
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,246
Not very effective
we're going to sit on that.

92
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:41,671
Of

93
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:42,930
still cast for

94
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,080
what.

95
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:46,606
Yeah I think the.

96
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,641
I think this is a case
where we could just like.

97
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,120
Sit

98
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,080
and when that

99
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
I want to punish the sky.

100
00:04:56,273 --> 00:05:00,570
I like the superpower is going to be
super effective against the show I get

101
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,808
so if he doesn't yield
than the fighting type

102
00:05:03,808 --> 00:05:04,170
is going to be super
effective as normal.

103
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,440
And if he does show that it's
just going to use all of the shields.

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,160
So he was once you have left.

105
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,730
And.

106
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,000
Dark I think I want to
switch to ferry here.

107
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,451
Like various getting a start.

108
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,551
Oh he's a show

109
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:24,731
not.

110
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,410
I dunno he's gotten.

111
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,020
Okay.

112
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:32,607
One.

113
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,040
Back to this guy
getting there and.

114
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,440
No he's my the shoe.

115
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,460
This is third pokemon
he hasn't shown up yet.

116
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:53,400
Why are using layer
on a master league.

117
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,319
Six thirty

118
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,050
cp

119
00:06:04,233 --> 00:06:05,233
am offended.

120
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,290
Alright

121
00:06:13,428 --> 00:06:15,330
used on the shields
you get one free it.

122
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:20,116
Super effective.

123
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:26,010
Pokemon wasn't super
a little amount of density.

124
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:29,890
Six could.

125
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:45,360
I'm.

126
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,370
Doing pretty good
so far in the spent.

127
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:54,281
He was going to be.

128
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,810
Pokey tuned his level to
he spent at least by battles.

129
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,300
This is not as fierce battle.

130
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,460
To get.

131
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:06,118
Pier.

132
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,500
Okay and switch.

133
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,580
To use with shoe.

134
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,510
You have the switch advantage
I'm gonna do at age because.

135
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,081
I'm going to assume
that he's going to shoot.

136
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,263
He does not you

137
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,540
okay that works too.

138
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,710
Secretary okay.

139
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:39,708
We used to the dragon tech news because
dragging a super effective against vegan.

140
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:43,620
So weird that executor is dragon

141
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,360
and like chars art is not.

142
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:49,920
Does block could.

143
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:52,121
Twice.

144
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:57,408
I think all the shields are going to get
used to get dragged vs dragon he's going to

145
00:07:57,432 --> 00:07:57,774
see Atlanta

146
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,250
these going to show
them to share with

147
00:07:59,274 --> 00:08:01,590
going gonna run out of shields and they've
already against the fifth arrangement was

148
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,590
going to.

149
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Kill the other.

150
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,339
And I'm totally fine with it.

151
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:15,238
Yeah

152
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,440
and he does

153
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:17,573
of the one that gets me.

154
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,270
Book.

155
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:21,520
Yeah.

156
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,259
And now it's my turn and
he's going to be destroyed

157
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,500
okay.

158
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,270
No good suit as
their pokemon is.

159
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,008
I do like the choice of executor like that
is a good pokemon go into master the with

160
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,200
that like shows.

161
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Moxie.

162
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
Let's see.

163
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,009
Okay so we

164
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:47,640
to

165
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:49,710
switch back to normal.

166
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,160
Get that electric versus
water type of vintage.

167
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,290
I.

168
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,830
The smell metal does not know a electric
to charge me they've got playing and steel.

169
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Like I've.

170
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,123
Thought about that quite a
lot then I thought yeah okay.

171
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,200
We could have the.

172
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,516
Like mela does no.

173
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:16,620
Electric

174
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:17,580
charge me but I

175
00:09:17,835 --> 00:09:19,595
liked the fighting in
the sealed combination.

176
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,060
And he

177
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,520
doesn't let spoken
to die just quits.

178
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,980
Hello.

179
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,400
That was a time of darkness.

180
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:55,708
The.

181
00:09:56,644 --> 00:09:57,644
Yeah.

182
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:04,282
Okay I meant.

183
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:05,572
Literally when.

184
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:06,762
I when the lesko.

185
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:08,002
That happen before the I

186
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:08,982
decided to

187
00:10:09,132 --> 00:10:10,132
just show me a bucks.

188
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:12,162
Okay

189
00:10:12,313 --> 00:10:13,754
because I could
do the battle please.

190
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:16,362
Alright how are we
doing here one two three.

191
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:17,963
And.

192
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:18,550
To.

193
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:20,093
Retreat for three.

194
00:10:20,773 --> 00:10:21,582
Three three

195
00:10:21,714 --> 00:10:22,179
get another one

196
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,502
to get that sweet rare candy

197
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,002
forget to more than we get that.

198
00:10:25,572 --> 00:10:26,772
Big boost to start as.

199
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:33,132
But we've already got the pokemon
catch a pokemon reward in the bag.

200
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:36,592
So there's no pressure.

201
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:41,699
Are we battling today.

202
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:45,072
Area sixty eight.

203
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:47,853
Sixty eight or the
born in sixty eight.

204
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:54,204
I have a theory chip

205
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:55,414
the to.

206
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:57,852
Everyone who plays
pokemon go's an adult.

207
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:00,102
Like I've never seen a
kid play pokemon go.

208
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:04,272
It's not quite you have seen kids play
pokemon go but only in the company of their

209
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:05,272
parents.

210
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:13,432
Did you see what he did.

211
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:16,792
I am definitely miss you.

212
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:18,552
And.

213
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:20,202
I'm going to assume.

214
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,502
That now that I've shown.

215
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:26,892
My fighting move
he's going to not she'll.

216
00:11:28,131 --> 00:11:29,953
The catch them his
pants down by using steel.

217
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:35,322
This is a calculated gamble.

218
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:37,452
Does he does he
showed he does okay.

219
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:40,572
So maybe that and he's just
going to see on the matter what.

220
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:42,982
How does shields now.

221
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:49,851
So

222
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:53,052
shields he doesn't have a steel
move okay that's interesting.

223
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:55,142
I could have not children.

224
00:11:57,828 --> 00:11:58,482
These are steel

225
00:11:58,659 --> 00:11:59,659
steel.

226
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:05,082
It's still super
effective against do.

227
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:07,417
Not steal is not very
effective against to.

228
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:10,122
Okay then I'm an
idiot I'm using the

229
00:12:10,242 --> 00:12:11,322
more expensive move.

230
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:13,872
There's less effective.

231
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:22,547
Yeah we don't do a good pokemon
go to your Chevy do trash but

232
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:23,774
go.

233
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,440
Switch.

234
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:31,852
Yeah we do.

235
00:12:32,232 --> 00:12:34,193
So you can switch is a
good chance to switch your.

236
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:37,090
To executor or right
writing vs during

237
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:40,212
I dunno like this is not alone then
executive this is regularly sector.

238
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:42,162
So it's not your typical.

239
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:45,622
In fact.

240
00:12:47,155 --> 00:12:48,155
Doesn't matter how to.

241
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,842
Was a lot of cpu
that are not going to

242
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,342
the Harriet's and how we got the

243
00:12:51,462 --> 00:12:52,512
ground person's electric.

244
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,429
How to put them on

245
00:12:54,654 --> 00:12:55,654
about of shields.

246
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:57,412
Can you get when you hit.

247
00:12:57,732 --> 00:12:58,732
Not affected.

248
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,112
I could do this all day.

249
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:05,532
How did he get to level three.

250
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:07,192
With these.

251
00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:08,862
Will see people
came on in Nashville.

252
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:13,698
I guess you don't have to win
to be able to you just have to.

253
00:13:13,722 --> 00:13:14,722
About.

254
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:16,932
Said it

255
00:13:17,082 --> 00:13:17,255
is it

256
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:18,502
okay.

257
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:19,912
Good for him for playing.

258
00:13:20,262 --> 00:13:21,262
All the way through.

259
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,263
But yeah you gotta love
up your book about it

260
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:26,332
actually.

261
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:30,402
Like as high as you can go.

262
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:33,462
For okay last battle to.

263
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:36,202
Lasko.

264
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
The stream.

265
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:40,162
Where loose.

266
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,622
Then at all on the line here.

267
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:47,082
Donald on a

268
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:48,232
level three.

269
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,922
He's got the verizon shirt
that music paid money.

270
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:52,942
Cause a serious player.

271
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:57,372
Pink

272
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,192
use the fighting to move
here it's not very effective

273
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:01,312
but.

274
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,432
The shields

275
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:04,552
and.

276
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,342
His shoe they.

277
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:07,212
Need is

278
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:08,498
that it's funny too.

279
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:11,792
Okay now he
knows it's funny too.

280
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,192
So now you will not shield.

281
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:18,202
I'm not going to she.

282
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,092
Said unless you.

283
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:23,057
You to can't do
anything against the.

284
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:26,551
Still to yes he's not
very effective to.

285
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:28,012
Loser.

286
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:30,578
Okay.

287
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:31,812
Had to get there fast

288
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,954
enough.

289
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:36,972
So I strike was that did a lot of
damage for not very effective.

290
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:41,298
So he's going to think it's fighting and
let it through he does not think of twenty

291
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:41,562
three

292
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:42,724
okay so I'm a switched

293
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:43,826
this one.

294
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:45,222
He's got the best
buddy ribbon on.

295
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:46,722
You've got a

296
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:47,962
here.

297
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:54,162
You get the best buddy ribbon on
make them your buddy and he gets a.

298
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,411
Oh and it's a shadow muted

299
00:14:56,532 --> 00:14:57,532

300
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:00,102
I'm gonna

301
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:00,732
say this

302
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:02,172
is correct okay.

303
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:07,542
Yeah this mutation is
not going to hell at me.

304
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,092
The only

305
00:15:10,302 --> 00:15:11,983
benefit years that
I've got the shield that

306
00:15:12,192 --> 00:15:12,971
to advantage

307
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:14,403
of that once you
have using them.

308
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,082
As switched the ferry.

309
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,322
Okay we got very vs drink.

During the club not very effective
that was why is not to shoot.

313
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:32,262
Just.

314

Nom nom nom all that period
goodness of your dragonite.

315

00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,840
Lucas.

323
00:15:48,162 --> 00:15:49,162
Not very effective.

324
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:53,292
Yeah I'm gonna use
my church move here.

325
00:15:55,051 --> 00:15:56,202
Then I'm just gonna

dragonite to death.

327

both super effective against right.

329
00:16:07,927 --> 00:16:08,927
So that.

330
00:16:09,642 --> 00:16:09,971
Yeah.

331
00:16:10,512 --> 00:16:10,782

When the scheme of the shoot.

334
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,976
Very effective.

335
00:16:19,452 --> 00:16:20,622
Do do do too.
