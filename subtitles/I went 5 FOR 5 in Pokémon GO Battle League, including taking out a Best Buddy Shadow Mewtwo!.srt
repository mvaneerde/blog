1
00:00:00,717 --> 00:00:02,177
We'll play a little more.

2
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:14,623
Level three! I have
increased my level by 50%!

3
00:00:18,783 --> 00:00:22,976
Uh-oh! We're tangling against a level
four! We're punching above our weight!

4
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:24,541
What are we gonna do?

5
00:00:26,936 --> 00:00:29,005
I start with a Melmetal;
he starts with a Dragonite.

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,730
Oh, good: Electric is
good against Flying.

7
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:33,960
Superpower move.

8
00:00:35,456 --> 00:00:38,640
I probably should have held onto this
move a little, because now it's obvious

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,767
that it's a very fast move, and
he's probably going to NOT shield.

10
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,605
Yeah, yeah. Um;

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,245
so I'm just gonna
farm some energy here,

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,010
and then I'll switch
over to Garchomp.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,030
Ehh... let's not shield yet.

14
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,880
Let's see what he's
got. Outrage? Okay.

15
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,657
So we got Outrage vs. Outrage here.

16
00:01:04,682 --> 00:01:08,586
This is actually sort of dumb. Why
am I doing a Dragon vs. Dragon?

17
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:16,055
Okay, now he will
definitely shield:

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,760
because he knows I
switched. Oh, he didn't shield!

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,746
Oh! Oh dear!

20
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:24,708
Mewtwo? Okay.

21
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,365
He hasn't shielded
at all yet? That's odd.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,888
Is he just not shielding? Because -
he's definitely gonna shield here, right?

23
00:01:36,912 --> 00:01:38,416
Yeah. Okay.

24
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:49,121
And I'm going to shield
here, because I want to, um,

25
00:01:49,146 --> 00:01:52,230
I want to save enough of that
energy to do another charged move.

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,985
I think I can get
one off. Here. Yeah.

27
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,045
Let's do the Earthquake move.

28
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,145
Gonna die anyway.

29
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,465
Let's hope that he
doesn't shield this time.

30
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:13,451
He does? That's odd; okay, fine.

31
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,026
Get knocked out.

32
00:02:17,778 --> 00:02:22,000
Eh, let's go back
and do this one.

33
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,194
Definitely going to shield here.

34
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:30,425
I think I want the Steel-type
charged move here,

35
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:34,570
and I think I have
enough HP left to pull it off.

36
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:45,785
Okay, you're out of
shields, and you're dead.

37
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:48,155
All right, now we've got one
Pokémon left, on each side.

38
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,892
Really? Can I do the Steel?

39
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:54,360
Can I do the Steel? I think I
can do the Steel. Okay, good.

40
00:02:54,385 --> 00:02:57,157
I want the Steel vs. Steel.

41
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:02,615
And then I end up with Fairy
vs. Psychic, which I think is:

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,480
nothing really. Ugh. Why
did I do the Steel? Idiot.

43
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,847
Why? Why are you using
your charged move? Why?

44
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,890
That's SUCH a waste of damage.

45
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:28,176
Okay this is a bad
matchup. He's gonna win.

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,110
Yeah, I lose.

47
00:03:37,234 --> 00:03:39,430
Earthquake? Nope,
that's not very effective.

48
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,190
Does he only have
one charged move?

49
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,736
Yeah and, I win, then!

50
00:03:54,596 --> 00:03:58,403
All right! Not-very-effective
wins against super-effective!

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,385
And this is why you don't use your charge
move when the other guy is almost dead!

52
00:04:07,171 --> 00:04:10,457
You save that charged
move, for the next Pokémon;

53
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,830
although, to be fair, I was about
to do a charged move of my own.

54
00:04:20,498 --> 00:04:24,305
Completely unearned
victory, there,

55
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,402
against the higher-level.

56
00:04:30,743 --> 00:04:32,761
Okay, we get a level one.

57
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,218
Are you there? Got
a Gmail notification.

58
00:04:39,243 --> 00:04:41,565
Oh, not very effective!
we're going to sit on that.

59
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,156
Steel vs. Steel -
Castform? What?

60
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:47,735
Yeah, I think, uh -

61
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,675
I think this is a case
where we could just, like,

62
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,557
sit, and win. But I
want to punish this guy.

63
00:04:56,137 --> 00:05:00,192
Yeah. Like, the Superpower is going
to be super effective against the shield -

64
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:02,657
against - so if he DOESN'T
shield, then the Fighting type

65
00:05:02,682 --> 00:05:04,775
is going to be super
effective against Normal,

66
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,009
and if he DOES shield, then he's
just going to use all of his shields.

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,752
So he has one shield left.

68
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:15,575
Um...

69
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,265
Dark? I think I want
to switch to Fairy here.

70
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,718
I think Fairy's
good against Dark.

71
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,995
I'll use a shield. Why not?
I don't know what he's got.

72
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,009
Okay.

73
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:33,061
<i>Whomp.</i>

74
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,890
Back to this guy
again? All right.

75
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,516
I'll use my other shield.

76
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:47,963
What is his third Pokémon?
He hasn't shown that one yet.

77
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:54,432
Why are you using a
Lairon in Master League?

78
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,566
638 CP. I'm offended.

79
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:16,132
Alright, you used all my
shields. You get one free hit.

80
00:06:19,116 --> 00:06:20,744
Super effective.

81
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,307
If your Pokémon wasn't super-low
level, it might have done something.

82
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,755
Six! Good-good.

83
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:48,023
Eh, doing pretty
good so far in this run.

84
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:54,905
Who's it going to be?

85
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,115
Poketuned! He's level two!
He's done at least five battles.

86
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,330
This is not his first battle.

87
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,345
What's he got?

88
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,145
Rhyperior. Okay,
I'm gonna switch.

89
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,315
Is he going to switch, too?

90
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,295
You have the switch advantage.
I'm gonna do Outrage, because

91
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,643
I'm going to assume
that he's going to shield.

92
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,443
He does not shield.
Okay, that works too.

93
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,344
Exeggutor. Okay.

94
00:07:36,369 --> 00:07:40,601
Now we use the Dragon-type move, because
Dragon is super effective against Dragon.

95
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:46,275
It's so weird that Exeggutor is
Dragon, and, like, Charizard is not.

96
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:52,862
He does block. Cool. Wise.

97
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,803
So, now, I think ALL the
shields are going to get used.

98
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:58,231
We've got Dragon vs. Dragon. He's going to
shield; I'm going to shield; He's going to

99
00:07:58,255 --> 00:07:59,988
shield; I'm going to shield; we're
all going to run out of shields;

100
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:04,898
and then whoever gets the fifth charged
move is going to kill the other one.

101
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,390
And I'm totally fine with it.

102
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:20,495
Okay, and he does another
one against me; and then I block.

103
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,745
Yup.

104
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,500
And now it's my turn, and he's
going to be destroyed. Okay.

105
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,280
Now we get to see what
his third Pokémon is.

106
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,031
I do like the choice
of Exeggutor.

107
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:43,150
Like, that is a good Pokémon go into Master
League with. That, like, shows moxie.

108
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,415
Let's see.

109
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,782
Okay, so we got - let's
switch back to Melmetal.

110
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,157
Get that Electric vs.
Water type advantage.

111
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,575
Um...

112
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,613
This Melmetal does not know a Electric-type
charged move. I've got Fighting and Steel.

113
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,675
Like I've thought about that quite
a lot: and I thought, yeah, okay,

114
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:16,799
we could have the - like,
Melmetal does know a Electric-type

115
00:09:16,824 --> 00:09:20,443
charged move, but I like the
Fighting and the Steel combination.

116
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,170
And he doesn't let his
Pokémon die: he just quits.

117
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:42,370
Hello. Hello?

118
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:57,982
<i>It was a time of darkness. It was
a world of fear.</i> What happened?

119
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:06,977
Okay I win. What do I
win? I win the last battle

120
00:10:07,002 --> 00:10:11,240
that happened before the app
decided to just show me a black screen.

121
00:10:11,832 --> 00:10:14,477
Okay. Let me go back
into the battle, please.

122
00:10:14,502 --> 00:10:16,938
Alright, how are we doing
here? One, two, three...

123
00:10:16,963 --> 00:10:20,630
and we've got... so,
we're three for three.

124
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:23,655
We're three for three! If we get another
one, we get that sweet Rare Candy;

125
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:29,147
if we get two more, than we
get that big boost of stardust;

126
00:10:29,172 --> 00:10:34,209
but we've already got the Pokémon
- catch a Pokémon reward in the bag.

127
00:10:35,592 --> 00:10:38,620
So there's no pressure, here.

128
00:10:40,663 --> 00:10:43,138
Who are we battling today?

129
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:46,307
Aryya68.

130
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:49,382
68. Were they born in '68?

131
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:56,027
I have a theory chat, that, uh,

132
00:10:56,052 --> 00:10:58,157
everyone who plays
Pokémon Go is an adult.

133
00:10:58,182 --> 00:11:01,127
Like, I've never seen a
kid play Pokémon Go.

134
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:03,220
That's not quite true. I HAVE
seen kids play Pokémon Go,

135
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,656
but ONLY in the
company of their parents.

136
00:11:12,432 --> 00:11:15,767
Did he shield? He did.

137
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:17,957
I am definitely going to shield;

138
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:24,167
and I'm going to assume
that now that I've shown

139
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:27,820
my fighting move, he's
going to NOT shield.

140
00:11:27,845 --> 00:11:30,769
So, I'm going to catch him with his
pants down, by using the Steel move.

141
00:11:34,062 --> 00:11:35,927
This is a calculated gamble.

142
00:11:35,952 --> 00:11:37,907
Does he - does he
shield? He does. Okay.

143
00:11:37,932 --> 00:11:41,957
So maybe, then, he's just
going to shield, no matter what.

144
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:43,991
He's out of shields now.

145
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:54,077
He's out of shields - he doesn't HAVE
a Steel move. Okay, that's interesting.

146
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:56,671
I could have NOT shielded.

147
00:11:57,828 --> 00:12:01,123
I'm going to use a
Steel against Steel.

148
00:12:02,894 --> 00:12:05,627
Uh, is Steel super
effective against Steel?

149
00:12:05,652 --> 00:12:08,117
No, Steel is not very
effective against Steel.

150
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:14,685
Okay then I'm an idiot. I'm using the
more expensive move, that's less effective.

151
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:24,366
Yeah we don't do GOOD Pokémon
Go here, chat. We do trash Pokémon Go.

152
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:28,273
I'mma switch.

153
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:35,087
There we go. Is he gonna switch?
He has a good chance to switch, here;

154
00:12:35,112 --> 00:12:37,217
to Exeggutor? All right!
Dragon vs. Dragon!

155
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:40,877
Oh, no, wait. This is not Alolan
Exeggutor. This is regular Exeggutor,

156
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:43,206
so it's not Dragon-type at all.

157
00:12:44,622 --> 00:12:48,336
In fact - oh, it
doesn't matter. Okay.

158
00:12:48,361 --> 00:12:49,965
It was a low enough CP
that I knocked it out anyway.

159
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,695
Okay, so now we got
the Ground vs. Electric.

160
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,387
I'm out of Pokémon.
I'm out of shields.

161
00:12:56,412 --> 00:13:00,497
Okay, you get one free hit. Not
effective. I could do this all day.

162
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:09,580
How did he get to level three with
these low-CP Pokémon in Master League?

163
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:16,607
I guess you don't have to WIN to be
level three: you just have to BATTLE.

164
00:13:16,632 --> 00:13:18,887
Is that it? That's it. Okay.

165
00:13:18,912 --> 00:13:23,477
Good for him for playing
it all the way through.

166
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:27,132
But, yeah. You gotta level up
your Pokémon in the Master League.

167
00:13:29,202 --> 00:13:30,402
Like as high as you can go.

168
00:13:31,992 --> 00:13:33,462
For okay last battle to.

169
00:13:35,202 --> 00:13:36,202
Lasko.

170
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:37,940
The stream.

171
00:13:39,162 --> 00:13:40,162
Where loose.

172
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,622
Then at all on the line here.

173
00:13:46,302 --> 00:13:47,082
Donald on a

174
00:13:47,232 --> 00:13:48,232
level three.

175
00:13:48,852 --> 00:13:50,922
He's got the verizon shirt
that music paid money.

176
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:52,942
Cause a serious player.

177
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:57,372
Pink

178
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,192
use the fighting to move
here it's not very effective

179
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:01,312
but.

180
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,432
The shields

181
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:04,552
and.

182
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,342
His shoe they.

183
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:07,212
Need is

184
00:14:07,498 --> 00:14:08,498
that it's funny too.

185
00:14:10,512 --> 00:14:11,792
Okay now he
knows it's funny too.

186
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,192
So now you will not shield.

187
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:18,202
I'm not going to she.

188
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,092
Said unless you.

189
00:14:21,342 --> 00:14:23,057
You to can't do
anything against the.

190
00:14:24,522 --> 00:14:26,551
Still to yes he's not
very effective to.

191
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:28,012
Loser.

192
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:30,578
Okay.

193
00:14:31,173 --> 00:14:31,812
Had to get there fast

194
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,954
enough.

195
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:36,972
So I strike was that did a lot of
damage for not very effective.

196
00:14:38,232 --> 00:14:41,298
So he's going to think it's fighting and
let it through he does not think of twenty

197
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:41,562
three

198
00:14:41,802 --> 00:14:42,724
okay so I'm a switched

199
00:14:42,826 --> 00:14:43,826

200
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:45,222
He's got the best
buddy ribbon on.

201
00:14:46,512 --> 00:14:46,722
You've got a

202
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:47,962

203
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:54,162
You get the best buddy ribbon on
make them your buddy and he gets a.

204
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,411
Oh and it's a shadow muted
