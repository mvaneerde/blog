1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:03,139
Okay. PowerShell is no use to me here.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,740
Let's start out with this opening
that I made up...

3
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:17,490
where we just move out all the Knights...

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,960
and all four center pawns.

5
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,690
And what should we do next?

6
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:35,020
Let's bring out the Bishops.

7
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,360
I don't like that.
It's too helpful.

8
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,830
Okay. Let's do 1. e4 e5;

9
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:46,564
2. d4 d5;

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,890
3. Nf3 Nf6;

11
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,560
bring out the Bishops;

12
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,760
and we castle.

13
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:00,326
Okay!

14
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,530
So we have Green, we have Yellow,
and we have Gray.

15
00:01:09,447 --> 00:01:13,200
So we know there's no e4,
we know there's no Nf6,

16
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:16,484
and there's no Bc4,
and there's no Bc5,

17
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,670
and we know there's no O-O.

18
00:01:22,023 --> 00:01:24,052
We're kind of done with PowerShell for this.

19
00:01:26,287 --> 00:01:27,694
Let me add Chessle here.

20
00:01:29,649 --> 00:01:31,823
Eh... I still need to adjust this scene.

21
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,677
Let's move that down a little...

22
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,723
... there we are.

23
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,575
Let's add more text here.

24
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,330
Okay!
For Yellow we have an e5...

25
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,670
... and a d4...

26
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:13,346
Rearrange the order in a minute.

27
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:15,180
e5, d4, d5,

28
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:17,031
Nf3.

29
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,670
We have no Greens.

30
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:23,080
One, two, three, four...
we have four Yellows.

31
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:26,100
One, two, three, four, five...
we have five Grays.

32
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:29,160
We count O-O as Gray because
it's the same...

33
00:02:30,737 --> 00:02:31,963
(okay, cool...)

34
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,430
like, we can't tell whether
it's Black or White that castles...

35
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,080
so this gray O-O means that
neither side castles during the opening.

36
00:02:46,493 --> 00:02:49,990
Okay, d4 is very probably White's move.

37
00:02:51,757 --> 00:02:52,783
So, Guess.

38
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,520
So, I think pretty...

39
00:02:54,963 --> 00:02:56,550
I'm going to guess that it's 1. d4

40
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,900
and then 1. ... d5.

41
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,469
Although e5?

42
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,540
Having e5 and d4 in the same opening is
a little weird. Maybe it's a French?

43
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,330
No because there's no e4.

44
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,260
So how can there be an e5?
It must be...

45
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,807
Black that plays ... e5,

46
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,453
because otherwise White would have
had to play e4 first. Okay.

47
00:03:20,646 --> 00:03:21,910
So 1. d4

48
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,418
1. ... d5

49
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,229
and then 2. c4 maybe.

50
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,610
Let me just draw them out here.

51
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,230
So I think it's going to be like this.
I'm not going to make this my submission.

52
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:38,580
And then I think
it's e5 HERE.

53
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,790
Maybe not right away.

54
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,870
Like the ... e5 must happen before
White plays the Knight.

55
00:03:53,703 --> 00:03:54,870
So maybe right away?

56
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,710
And then, takes...

57
00:04:20,496 --> 00:04:21,769
and then here...

58
00:04:22,522 --> 00:04:23,860
and then here...

59
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,660
and then ... c5...

60
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,320
here. I've covered e5,
d4 and d5, and Nf3.

61
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,003
Okay. So my guess is that it's...

62
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:52,633
1. d4 d5

63
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,080
2. c4 c5...

64
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,650
no. 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5

65
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,853
3. dxe5

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,339
No this can't be it,
because there's a d4.

67
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:13,290
So how do you play this opening...

68
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,830
without d5-d4...

69
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:23,843
given that it's White to move?

70
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:56,680
Okay, material's even.

71
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,840
There's no Nf6.

72
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,330
4. ... c5?

73
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,730
Let's go here.

74
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:15,670
There's no d4.

75
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,520
5. ... d4 seems like such
a natural move here.

76
00:06:37,593 --> 00:06:40,384
There might be a ... d4!
BOTH sides could play d4.

77
00:06:47,226 --> 00:06:49,299
Okay, so what are the
unique moves in my guess?

78
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,630
d4 and d5...

79
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:55,598
we already knew about.
c4 and e5 we already,

80
00:06:55,622 --> 00:06:58,875
well, e5 we already knew about,
Nf3 we already knew about, so the unique

81
00:06:59,508 --> 00:07:02,275
elements of this guess are c4.

82
00:07:04,204 --> 00:07:07,170
So I w... - so I want to try c4,

83
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:14,788
I want to try exd4,
I want to try Nxd4

84
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,252
I want to try c4...
I want to try c5,

85
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:20,490
I want to try Nb5,

86
00:07:20,546 --> 00:07:22,290
and I kind of wanna
try d4 twice.

87
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,538
Some of these are more
natural than others.

88
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:27,350
So I'm going to go all the way
back to the beginning,

89
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:29,850
and I'm going to guess 1. c4.

90
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:36,180
Okay.

91
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,938
Now, I can't really try exd4 or Nxd4
because they rely on d4

92
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:42,703
which I don't want to bother with,

93
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:44,040
but there is 1. ... c5.

94
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:50,850
Now, let's try 2. Nc3.
We haven't tried that.

95
00:07:54,193 --> 00:07:55,873
And I'm going to try 2. ... e6.

96
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,103
Keep the Knight out.

97
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,600
And I want to try 3. g3.

98
00:08:07,296 --> 00:08:09,909
I know it's NOT 3. ... d5,
so I'm going to try 3. ... g6,

99
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:13,030
and fianchetto both Bishops.

100
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,691
I don't want to bother with Nf3.

101
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,803
I know there's a d4 so I
don't want to bother with d5 -

102
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:25,680
I mean, I know there's a d4 so
I don't want to bother with d3.

103
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,521
Hey therock_dwayne,
thanks for the follow!

104
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:31,720
Welcome to Chessle.

105
00:08:37,073 --> 00:08:38,380
I could try 5. b3.

106
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,562
What do I know about e-pushes?
We know e5 is a move.

107
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:51,750
Oh, well if I know e5 is a move
then I don't want to bother with e6.

108
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,600
Okay. So I'll do 2. ... g6
right away and 3. g3

109
00:08:57,647 --> 00:08:59,107
and we'll fianchetto,

110
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:05,440
and then let's do the b-pawns,

111
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,536
and we'll fianchetto this way too.

112
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,040
Okay.

113
00:09:16,899 --> 00:09:19,540
So we got another yellow!
This is good.

114
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:22,005
Let me rearrange these
alphabetically.

115
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,500
d4 d5

116
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,731
e5

117
00:09:26,511 --> 00:09:27,511
Nf3.

118
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:29,828
We know c4 is a yellow,

119
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,300
and we know g3 is a yellow.
Oh, it's looking like a Catalan.

120
00:09:36,486 --> 00:09:37,766
Okay.

121
00:09:40,584 --> 00:09:44,212
Uh, let's try our other grays.
We know there's no c5.

122
00:09:44,236 --> 00:09:46,050
Let me put these in
alphabetical order too.

123
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:49,023
Knight comes here.

124
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:55,978
c5, there's no c5.

125
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,510
We know there's no Nc3.

126
00:09:59,925 --> 00:10:01,326
We know there's no g6.

127
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:20,376
How far can you see?
You can see up to O-O. Okay.

128
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:31,166
All right, so let's cut this off here
and do a new line. Okay.

129
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,793
Actually, let's cut it off here.

130
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:41,170
Okay, c5, Nc3, g6,

131
00:10:42,223 --> 00:10:43,936
Bg7,

132
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:49,030
Bg2,

133
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
b6,

134
00:10:57,673 --> 00:10:58,839
b3,

135
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,533
(I don't have any greens!)

136
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:14,286
and Bb7. Okay.

137
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:23,940
Okay, so we do know, one
two three four five six,

138
00:11:23,965 --> 00:11:26,108
we know six yellow moves.
We know c4,

139
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,590
e5, d4, d5, Nf3, g3.

140
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,472
It's probably in this order:

141
00:11:32,497 --> 00:11:35,050
1. d4 d5

142
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:36,570
2. c4...

143
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,150
it's Black's move...

144
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:43,350
Black does, something,
I dunno, let's do...

145
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,140
uh, we know it's NOT 2. ... Nf6...

146
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:48,870
we know... let's try 2. ... c6.

147
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Caro-Kann.

148
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,760
Well, not a Caro-Kann. A Slav.

149
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,130
Caro-Kann is with the e-pawn
instead of the c-pawn.

150
00:11:57,364 --> 00:12:00,456
And then let's do 3. g3,

151
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:03,301
and let's do 3. ... takes.

152
00:12:03,933 --> 00:12:06,240
We know he doesn't play
the Knight - 4. Bg2,

153
00:12:08,223 --> 00:12:09,480
and we know he doesn't do 4. e4.

154
00:12:14,746 --> 00:12:16,060
What does he do?

155
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,641
4. Qc2 maybe? 4. Qc2 is a terrible idea,
because you take the...

156
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:31,100
Pbbt.
All right, let's back it up.

157
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:35,134
Okay, we think it's 1. d4 d5.

158
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:38,610
And we know there's a c4,
so it might as well be here.

159
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,611
We think the next move is
going to be 3. g3.

160
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,807
No, the next move isn't 3. g3.
g3 comes later.

161
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,700
Or it could be on move 2.

162
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:58,290
Let's do 2. ... take, 3. Nf3.

163
00:13:07,816 --> 00:13:09,810
We know there's a d5.
Maybe it's here.

164
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,384
Oh, it's White's - Black's move.

165
00:13:25,383 --> 00:13:28,150
There's no e4. It could be a ... c-takes.

166
00:13:38,727 --> 00:13:41,300
So, Black is up a pawn here.

167
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,948
Okay, so what moves do I want to try?

168
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:52,410
d4, d5, c4; those are on the yellow list.

169
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:55,065
I want to try dxc4. That seems
like a reasonable try.

170
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,754
Nf3 is on my yellow list.

171
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,691
I want to try e5. e5's on my yellow list.
Good, I got that in there.

172
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,560
g3. g3 is on the yellow list.

173
00:14:09,435 --> 00:14:12,155
I want to try exd4, Qxd4, Qxd4.

174
00:14:20,983 --> 00:14:24,698
Okay. So let's go back and
let's try those moves

175
00:14:24,722 --> 00:14:30,160
WITHOUT duplicating the moves
that we already know are yellow.

176
00:14:32,187 --> 00:14:33,300
Okay.

177
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,950
Well I have to get
a Pawn to c4.

178
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,140
There's only one yellow Knight move!

179
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,850
Let's do it this way.

180
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:10,138
I want to get the Knight there.

181
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:31,366
Have I tried Nc6?
I have not.

182
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:35,663
And I want to try this.

183
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:41,430
One, two three; one, two three. Okay.
Three attackers, three defenders.

184
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,693
Let's try that.

185
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,731
Okay, good! We got green.
Got some greens.

186
00:16:00,237 --> 00:16:03,091
We got 1. d4 d5 2. c4.

187
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,253
And, we know that they
don't take: that's gray.

188
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:21,147
Okay.

189
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:24,941
And we know there's no Nc3 -
oh, I DID know there was no Nc3!

190
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:26,767
Why did I play Nc3?

191
00:16:27,776 --> 00:16:30,790
That was a waste.
Idiot!

192
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,901
Okay, I know e5 is not THERE.

193
00:16:35,673 --> 00:16:39,091
It's probably on the 2nd move, then.

194
00:16:39,231 --> 00:16:43,291
There's no e3.
e3 comes before e4.

195
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,293
Let me make this a little smaller.

196
00:16:54,021 --> 00:16:55,021
There we go.

197
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:01,271
Uh, we now know where Nc6 is.

198
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,364
Okay.

199
00:17:19,191 --> 00:17:21,300
We're narrowing it
down very well here,

200
00:17:22,354 --> 00:17:25,265
but we have to get everything right
in order to win.

201
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,944
So this is tricky.

202
00:17:28,641 --> 00:17:29,787
Okay.

203
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,650
So, we - let's try 2. ... e5 right away.

204
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,126
This is a move.
It's not a very good move,

205
00:17:35,151 --> 00:17:36,541
but you do see it.

206
00:17:39,543 --> 00:17:40,791
And...

207
00:17:40,823 --> 00:17:43,665
it's actually quite common
for White to take here.

208
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:50,528
We know that the
Knight comes to c6,

209
00:17:51,051 --> 00:17:55,231
So that makes it unlikely
that he takes on d5.

210
00:18:02,496 --> 00:18:04,429
There could be a second d4.

211
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:18,565
Uh, we haven't tried this move,
have we? Nd7? No. I mean, Ne7?

212
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:27,221
NOW 4. g3.

213
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,857
4. ... Nc6.

214
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:38,141
And we know there's no Bg2.

215
00:18:41,686 --> 00:18:42,934
Maybe take here?

216
00:18:45,997 --> 00:18:47,543
And then Queen takes?

217
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,998
Okay, so this fits with all our greens.
d4, d5, c4 -

218
00:18:52,023 --> 00:18:54,822
Nbc6! Okay, it does NOT. Okay.

219
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:59,225
Nbc6 is not the same as Nc6.

220
00:19:05,897 --> 00:19:07,649
Okay, so 3. ... d4.

221
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:16,054
We know there's a g3.
Let's do HERE.

222
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,284
NOW the 4. ... Nc6.

223
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,668
Let's do 5. f4,

224
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:31,650
and let's do 5. ... Bc5.

225
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:38,932
Okay.
"1. d4 d5 2. c4 ?"? Yes.

226
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:44,094
2. ... e5 - that's a yellow.
I'll get to the yellows.

227
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:53,161
"?", another d4.
Okay. 4 g3 Nc6.

228
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:56,096
Okay, so it matches all of our greens.
Let's check all the yellows.

229
00:19:56,331 --> 00:20:00,076
Is there a c4? Yes, on move 2.
This does not...

230
00:20:01,791 --> 00:20:04,256
This is not conflict with
1. c4 on move 1. Cool.

231
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:08,461
d4. 1. d4 is on move 1. Yes.

232
00:20:09,423 --> 00:20:11,974
This is not yellow anymore.
This is green.

233
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:15,751
d5. Yes. Also not yellow anymore.

234
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:21,125
In fact, c4 isn't yellow
anymore either.

235
00:20:21,381 --> 00:20:25,981
Is there an e5? Yes we have
the 2. ... e5 as Black's move two.

236
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:29,963
Is there a g3? Yes.
Is there a Nf3?

237
00:20:30,411 --> 00:20:32,655
No, I did not ever move Nf3!

238
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:35,040
Okay, so let's back it up.

239
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:38,982
Instead of 5. f4
let's do 5. Nf3,

240
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:44,281
and then 5. ... Bb- Bc5.
Okay. Overprotecting.

241
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:48,199
We could also do 5. ... Bg4.

242
00:20:49,761 --> 00:20:50,912
I think maybe I will.

243
00:20:54,988 --> 00:20:59,552
The idea is to threaten to take
the Knight and then to take the Pawn,

244
00:20:59,577 --> 00:21:01,190
and then White can pin.
Let's try that.

245
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,426
Oh, so close!
Okay, we got the first few moves!

246
00:21:07,501 --> 00:21:10,058
We got 1. d4 d5 2. c4 e5!

247
00:21:11,303 --> 00:21:13,079
e5 is no longer yellow.

248
00:21:14,687 --> 00:21:16,422
We have 3. dxe5!

249
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:21,961
And then we have a second d4!
They did a double letter!

250
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,785
Good-good-good-good-good.

251
00:21:27,141 --> 00:21:30,850
Okay. So the g3 is in
the puzzle somewhere.

252
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:34,649
It's not move 1, it's not move 2, it's not
move 3, it's not move 4. It MUST be move 5.

253
00:21:36,486 --> 00:21:38,993
So I'm guessing this is 5. g3.

254
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:46,105
So now all we need to do is
figure out what White's move is here.

255
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:50,283
Okay, so what are our grays?
We got another gray.

256
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,120
We got another Bg4 here.

257
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,288
Let me just check that we have
all the grays. We have e4,

258
00:21:59,141 --> 00:22:00,844
we have Nf6,

259
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:08,486
yes; we have Bc4, Bc5; O-O;
we have c5;

260
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:11,366
we have Nc3; g6;

261
00:22:11,391 --> 00:22:15,296
Bg7, of course, we can't
do Bg7 if there's no g6;

262
00:22:15,321 --> 00:22:18,326
Bg2, of course;

263
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:21,075
b6; b3; Bb7;

264
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,005
no fianchettoing at all;

265
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:28,889
the dxc4 is gray; Nc3,

266
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,586
we knew that twice (stupid!);

267
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:34,708
e3; Nge2; okay;

268
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,808
Bb4, also gray;

269
00:22:45,678 --> 00:22:47,387
okay; okay-okay-okay;

270
00:22:48,741 --> 00:22:52,049
and Bg4! Good. So that's all of our grays.

271
00:22:53,808 --> 00:22:56,486
Okay, so we know it's
all right up to this point.

272
00:22:56,511 --> 00:23:01,772
Now what moves does White have that we
haven't tried yet? We haven't tried Bb4.

273
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,937
I can't highlight on this board.

274
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:09,903
But, like this is the idea.

275
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:19,421
So, we know 4. g3 and 5. Nf3 are the right
moves - they're just in the wrong order!

276
00:23:19,461 --> 00:23:24,656
Okay so it's  4. Nf3 right away,
and then 4. ... Nc6,

277
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:31,434
and then 5. g3, and now we know
every move except for Black's last.

278
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:34,706
We know it's not 5. ... Bg4, even
though that seems like a sensible move.

279
00:23:34,731 --> 00:23:37,646
Could it be 5. ... Bb4+?

280
00:23:37,671 --> 00:23:45,159
We know that it's not Bb4, but this
would be WITH A CHECK and that changes

281
00:23:45,184 --> 00:23:50,891
the symbol, which means it's not quite
the same move from a Chessle sense.

282
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:59,222
Okay, let's try that.

283
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:03,030
Oh, so close!

284
00:24:11,426 --> 00:24:13,873
Okay, so we know everything
except the last move!

285
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:18,359
What is Black's move here?

286
00:24:31,876 --> 00:24:36,416
It's not 5. ... Bc5, we tried that
already. We have a gray.

287
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:39,536
It's not 5. ... Bb4+.

288
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,416
Could be 5. ... Be7?

289
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:49,325
We know it's not 5. ... Nge7 - or -
Nge2 or Nge7?

290
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:55,706
It could be 5. ... Nge7.
It could very well be this.

291
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:58,226
We have not tried that.

292
00:24:58,251 --> 00:25:01,681
Okay, the idea being to go to g6.

293
00:25:01,706 --> 00:25:03,432
Okay, let's try that.

294
00:25:04,371 --> 00:25:08,638
Oh yeah!
Oh yeah!

295
00:25:10,534 --> 00:25:12,843
38% of people got it right today.

296
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:16,261
Six tries.

297
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:21,345
I need to be careful about
not reusing greens.

298
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,166
Like, I reused a lot of greens in this
puzzle and that really slowed me down.

299
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,129
But it took me:
one, two, three, four, five, six.

300
00:25:35,481 --> 00:25:37,175
Chessle: six!
