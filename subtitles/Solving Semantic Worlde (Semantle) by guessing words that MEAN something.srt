1
00:00:01,012 --> 00:00:03,600
So what is Semantle?
Semantle is a game

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,940
where you try to guess the secret word,<br />
and it has nothing to do with how it is spelled,

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,950
it has everything to
do with what it means.

4
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,660
For example

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:26,550
If the word

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:27,839
is "GRAPE"

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,920
Then "ORANGE" will be very
similar because they're both fruit.

8
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:35,298
Let me adjust this...

9
00:00:42,846 --> 00:00:45,960
Okay! So I'm gonna guess
something generic... I'm gonna guess...

10
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,140
"HUMAN" is very very cold.

11
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:01,929
Let me rearrange things a little.

12
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:15,660
Okay! So "HUMAN" is
extremely UN-similar.

13
00:01:17,137 --> 00:01:18,850
Let's try "CAR."

14
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,577
Still cold. Okay.

15
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,869
Let's try "KITCHEN."

16
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,897
Still very cold. Okay.

17
00:01:29,377 --> 00:01:32,643
Let's try "LOVE."

18
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,337
Let's try...

19
00:01:47,198 --> 00:01:48,198
"NATION."

20
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:02,079
Let's try "LAUNDRY."

21
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,780
"CAT."

22
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:22,723
"ELEPHANT."

23
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:29,137
"PLANET."

24
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:35,707
"POLITICS."

25
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:39,200
Closer.

26
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,656
"POLITICS" but not "NATION."

27
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,256
Uh, "GEOGRAPHY."

28
00:02:53,723 --> 00:02:55,617
"DEMOCRACY."

29
00:02:58,123 --> 00:03:01,683
Okay, "POLITICS" but not "DEMOCRACY."
How about "EMOTION?"

30
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,525
No, "LOVE" would be very close.

31
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,930
How about "ARGUE?"

32
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,283
"COMPETITION."

33
00:03:14,883 --> 00:03:19,803
Ooo! Okay, so "POLITICS"
has a competitive element.

34
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:21,310
How about a sport?

35
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,136
How about "TENNIS?"

36
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:29,936
How about "BATTLE?"

37
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,790
Competition...

38
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,963
"GAME."

39
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:41,750
Okay, "GAME" is the closest I've got so far.

40
00:03:44,313 --> 00:03:45,760
How about "CHESS?"

41
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:49,990
"CARDS?"

42
00:03:51,643 --> 00:03:53,390
"POKER?"

43
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:57,610
Tepid! Woo!

44
00:03:59,415 --> 00:04:00,415
Gettin' there...

45
00:04:02,341 --> 00:04:03,690
We can try other card games...

46
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,154
How about "TAROT?"

47
00:04:12,506 --> 00:04:15,458
What other competitive games are
there that don't use cards?

48
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:20,463
"FOOTBALL."

49
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,960
Why are the numbers out of order?

50
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,129
Oh, I see. These are
the ones that are closest.

51
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,420
How about "BLACKJACK?"

52
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,920
Okay, "POKER..." "BLACKJACK..."

53
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:15,123
What other games do you
play with cards? "BRIDGE?"

54
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,150
Hmm...

55
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,203
A blackjack is a weapon.

56
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,860
You can hit somebody over the
head with it, like a club.

57
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,850
How about "CASINO?"

58
00:05:56,218 --> 00:05:58,120
"BLACKJACK" is closer.
"GAMBLE?"

59
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,470
"LUCK?"

60
00:06:22,737 --> 00:06:24,697
"CARDSHARK?"

61
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,350
"I don't know the word
'CARDSHARK.'" Okay.

62
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:29,150
"DEALER?"

63
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,960
Okay, "BLACKJACK" is quite close.

64
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,627
"SLOT?"

65
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,030
Wow!

66
00:06:58,993 --> 00:07:04,333
Okay it's... "BLACKJACK" is close to "SLOT"
because you play slot machines in a casino.

67
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,367
(exhales)
