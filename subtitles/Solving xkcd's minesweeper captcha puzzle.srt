1
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:12,494
So, hold on.

2
00:00:16,576 --> 00:00:22,570
So, todays xkcd has this CAPTCHA where
you have to figure out where the mines are,

3
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:27,921
and so I thought I would try to
take a hand at solving it.

4
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:37,056
So this is a take-off on the game
Minesweeper, where you're given all these

5
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:42,515
numbers, and then blank squares,
and you have to try to figure out

6
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,666
what numbers belong
in the blank squares.

7
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:53,500
The number tells you how many
mines are in adjacent squares.

8
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:59,720
So of the three squares that
are adjacent to the corner -

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,520
and diagonal counts -
two of them have mines;

10
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:15,455
and of the four squares that are
adjacent to this one over here,

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,870
only one of them has a mine;

12
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:26,735
and so we should be able to do,
with some logic, figure out

13
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,536
which the question marks
are mines, and which are not.

14
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:36,000
So I will use M for Mine;
and I will use C = Clear;

15
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:39,713
? = Unknown.

16
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,085
Okay, so let's start
with this 3 here:

17
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:58,950
three of these are mines,
but of these two squares -

18
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:02,363
B3 and A4 - they
can't BOTH be mines,

19
00:02:02,396 --> 00:02:05,255
because if they were
both mines, then this

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,645
square would have at least
two mines adjacent to it.

21
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,815
So only one of these is a
mine, and the other one is clear:

22
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,935
that is to say, between these two squares -
there's only one mine between them,

23
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,731
which means that both
of these have to be mines.

24
00:02:19,756 --> 00:02:23,740
M, M.
Okay.

25
00:02:29,206 --> 00:02:35,239
I still don't know which one of these
is the mine, and which one is clear,

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,980
but now that I look at this 2, I can see
that there's already two mines next to it

27
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:40,805
so this one must be clear,

28
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,475
and in fact, if I look
at this 1 here,

29
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,822
of these four, I know that three of
them are clear and the other one's a mine.

30
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:54,125
So this is clear, this is
clear, and this is clear.

31
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,947
Okay.

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,335
In fact I know that
not only is this clear,

33
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,575
but this is a 2.

34
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,160
When you normally play Minesweeper,
and you click on a box (that's NOT a mine)

35
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,686
it'll give you the number;

36
00:03:13,711 --> 00:03:17,255
but we're not playing that
kind of Minesweeper; we're doing

37
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,773
"xkcd CAPTCHA" Minesweeper.

38
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:34,057
Okay.

39
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,806
So this guy here has three
mines next to it, which means that

40
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:46,203
two of these are mines,
and the third one is clear;

41
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:50,707
and, by a very similar exercise,

42
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:54,935
these two are both next
to this number 1 here,

43
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:02,363
which means only one of these can
be clear, and the other one's a mine;

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,835
so to get this all the
way up to three, we need

45
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,452
one of these, AND this
one. So this one is a mine.

46
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,975
I don't know which one of these it
is, but now that I had put this M here,

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,910
this 3 is full; so I
know this guy is clear,

48
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:27,545
and this 1 is clear, so I know
that all of these three are clear.

49
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:33,095
I could also use the same logic
between this 3 and this 1,

50
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,235
to prove that only one of these is a
mine, and therefore THIS is a mine,

51
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,010
but I don't need it. So I can
use a C here, and a C here,

52
00:04:43,138 --> 00:04:46,394
and a C here (because of this 1.)

53
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:49,625
Okay, and now there's
only one square left,

54
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,575
and we know it's a
mine because of this,

55
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,220
and we know it's the
third mine for this guy.

56
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,563
Okay, and so the answers are -

57
00:05:16,197 --> 00:05:18,390
ah! -

58
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:37,336
"Shapes;" okay -

59
00:05:41,616 --> 00:05:52,950
answers are: here,
here, here, and here.

60
00:05:55,043 --> 00:05:58,145
And let's just do a last check:

61
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:01,236
the 2 has two mines next to it;

62
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,845
the 1 has one mine next to it;

63
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,265
the 3 has three mines next to it;
the 3 has three mines next to it;

64
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:09,905
the 1 has one;
and the 1 has one:

65
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,365
so, this checks out!

66
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:17,616
Thank you for watching me
solve xkcd's Minesweeper puzzle.
