1
00:00:00,048 --> 00:00:07,960
I had only Pawns; and my opponent
made a Queen; and I did not:

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,820
but I won!
Okay.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,600
So the game itself starts
out - that's a nice little French.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,940
We played the Exchange.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,529
It's very even; open.

6
00:00:26,418 --> 00:00:29,124
I like these kinda
positions, from either side.

7
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:35,093
I fianchetto my Queen-side
Bishop so that I can try to get

8
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:41,230
some kind of attack on the
King-side, reinforce my d-pawn;

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,538
press - put some pressure
on this square so that

10
00:00:43,562 --> 00:00:45,510
it becomes very
uncomfortable for him to occupy.

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:49,400
Doot-de-doo, he decides
to take this square instead.

12
00:00:49,426 --> 00:00:53,155
Okay, I'm undermining the
d4-pawn, and I've got this

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,830
nice connected set of pawns here.

14
00:00:56,626 --> 00:01:00,368
Doot-de-doo - he lashes
out on the kingside,

15
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,605
which makes this square
much more open for me,

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,480
and yet it does tend
to cramp my King;

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:13,500
so I put the Knight here. I'm hoping to
get the e4 square for my Pawn. I get it.

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,552
He trades off here, he's trying
to isolate my queenside pawns.

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,445
We trade Queens. Okay,
so there's not much hope of a

20
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,715
mating attack anymore,
with the Queens off the board,

21
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,993
and we're going to contest the
file. This move was a little bit weak.

22
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:36,226
What does the computer want? The computer
suggests going to f6 instead. Fine,

23
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,198
but the idea here is that it
solidifies the pawn on e4.

24
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:44,250
This pawn is now a
protected passed pawn,

25
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:49,175
which gives me, I think, an
advantage in the endgame,

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,170
whereas White's extra pawn is not passed.

27
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,860
Okay, we trade Rooks. He says
"I'm going to contest the d-file again."

28
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:04,685
All right, we'll trade Rooks again! So now
we're down to an endgame with only pieces -

29
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:10,509
no Rooks or Queens - and I make
this move which is absolutely terrible

30
00:02:10,534 --> 00:02:15,270
because it allows White to go here,
forking the Bishop and the Pawn.

31
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,025
The idea in my head when I played this
move was: I saw that my Bishop had now,

32
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:26,225
having served its role as
the guardian of the e4 square,

33
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,955
now it needed to find something else
to do: because with this pawn protected,

34
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,273
the - I don't need to worry
about supporting e4 anymore

35
00:02:34,297 --> 00:02:37,175
and now it's just a wall in front of
my Bishop. So I thought, all right,

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,795
"let's move the Bishop out around the
wall and maybe go after these pawns,"

37
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,925
but what I missed was, oh my God,

38
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,685
I have just abandoned
the guard on this square,

39
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,820
and this beautifully placed
Knight should just leap there,

40
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,300
and win my h-pawn - er, my a-pawn.

41
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,475
Instead he plays this move,
which is weak. I get out of the fork -

42
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,325
although it would
probably have been better

43
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,795
to go out of the fork -
to just retreat the Bishop

44
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,050
and guard the square.

45
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:16,056
But instead, I allow him
this really good move,

46
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:20,560
which would take a7 again,
because I can't retreat the Bishop

47
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,450
to protect the pawn, because then
he just takes the Bishop with his Knight.

48
00:03:24,586 --> 00:03:30,471
Okay, he misses it too. He brings in
the Knight, and I'm, like, alright, let's -

49
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,495
this pawn here -

50
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,125
it's going to be super weak.
I'm gonna take this Bishop -

51
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,285
take this Knight
with the Bishop,

52
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,845
lure his pawn onto the e5
square, and then it's vulnerable.

53
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:45,335
That was the idea
in my head. Actually,

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,055
the reality that position in the
cold light of analysis is that it's

55
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,795
"dynamically balanced."

56
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,855
The Pawn is weak,
but it is also strong.

57
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,186
It is dynamic play.

58
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,535
So i'm innocently going to
go and round up the pawn,

59
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,765
But I - my idea is to go here
next move - what I missed is that,

60
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,811
White has this fork, and
then he's checking the King,

61
00:04:08,836 --> 00:04:11,621
and he's going to
pick up the Bishop.

62
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:14,345
<i>But Matt!</i>, you say, <i>the Bishop
is guarded by the Knight!</i>

63
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,480
Yeah, but he can TAKE the Knight,

64
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,715
removing the guard of the
Bishop, and THEN do the fork,

65
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,715
so it's not so easy.

66
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:28,025
He misses that idea and
he pushes the b-pawn.

67
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,705
I accidentally get the right
idea which is to go back here,

68
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,595
and chase the Knight away,

69
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,113
and THEN bring in the King.

70
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,655
He reinforces the Knight,
which is not so good,

71
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,565
and I bring in the King,

72
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:48,090
and I'm going to win this pawn.

73
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,955
So he checks me,
which is a bad idea;

74
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,005
I DO win the Pawn,
I am now UP material;

75
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:06,730
and he comes in here. What's he thinking?
He's going to go after this pawn here.

76
00:05:09,043 --> 00:05:11,096
He is undercutting.

77
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,295
So I'm thinking here,

78
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,755
and I'm thinking to myself - <i>you know,
I've got these passed pawns I want to push;</i>

79
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,415
<i>I want to get my king
to one of these squares;</i>

80
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,372
<i>and I want to protect this pawn.
So what's the best move for me?</i> -

81
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:33,395
and I come up with this move,

82
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:37,215
which, the idea is, to protect the
pawn first, and then also kind of

83
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:40,595
guard this square, cause I'm worried
about - <i>okay, what if he pushes here</i>

84
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,415
<i>and if he pushes
here then I can go here,</i>

85
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,605
<i>and the Knight protects
that square too</i> -

86
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,715
and then he does indeed push g3,

87
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,245
and... and I see at this
point that this Bishop -

88
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,175
er, that this Knight has
no squares. It can't go here,

89
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,932
because the Knight guards it;
it can't go here because of the

90
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:04,921
King; it can't go here because
of the King, and it can't go here...

91
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,270
or can it?

92
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,135
Well, in fact, it CAN go there.

93
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,770
If the Knight goes here, then it LOOKS like
I can capture the Knight, but that is fake,

94
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,310
because then White has
this beautiful move Bf4+.

95
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:31,865
The King has to
move out of the way,

96
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,765
and then the Knight recovers -
the Bishop recovers the Knight,

97
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:39,340
and we just have an opposite-Bishop
endgame. Probably a draw.

98
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,155
Yeah, I've got the passed
Pawn; yeah I'm a Pawn up;

99
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:46,301
but White can just blockade
on the dark squares,

100
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:51,532
and, uh, and Black
has nothing. Okay.

101
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,705
So White has that resource,
which I did not see at the time,

102
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:00,935
so I moved the Bishop here.
I am very happy with myself.

103
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,645
All I have to do is take the Knight,
and there's nothing he can do to stop it.

104
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:09,635
So he did have
the Nc7 move, as -

105
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,185
he probably still loses,
but - it's his best option,

106
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,485
that - he kind of misses up the order
a little, what he does, is, he plays Bf4.

107
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,056
And now I have a choice to make:

108
00:07:24,883 --> 00:07:27,616
do I abandon my Pawn?

109
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,095
I can either: move forward
here, then his Knight escapes;

110
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,205
or I can exchange the
Knight for the Bishop,

111
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:45,275
win this Pawn in exchange for this
one, and then I have TWO passed pawns,

112
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,255
supported by the King.

113
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,085
That's what I'm
going to do. Okay.

114
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,400
Take the Bishop. He takes back.

115
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:04,025
I take the Pawn. I'm in
check, I cannot save this Pawn:

116
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:06,580
the Bishop - the Knight's
going to take it. He takes it.

117
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:17,105
Now how do you get these passed pawns all
the way down to the board to make a Queen?

118
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,715
They're on light squares, and the
Bishop's on light squares too, so

119
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,255
Black has to be careful not to
allow White to set up a blockade,

120
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,850
and then the Knight is
going to come back,

121
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:37,145
and it's going to help out the King,
and it could be a tough struggle.

122
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:43,146
So, what I say to myself is,
<i>I'm going to cut off the Knight</i> -

123
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:45,665
I'm still sort of
entertaining ideas of,

124
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,725
maybe he'll make a mistake?

125
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,185
Like, he really only has one move in this
position. He has to move the Knight here.

126
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,415
Eh, that's not quite true.

127
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,066
But, um, the Knight has four
squares that it can move to,

128
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,435
and the Bishop covers
three of those squares,

129
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:08,315
so if the King can get in,
then he can win the Knight,

130
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,195
and then I'll be up a whole piece.

131
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,475
So that forces him to bring his
Knight to the edge of the board,

132
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,945
and I'm thinking <i>all right, good
now I can move by King forward;</i>

133
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,705
<i>I can start advancing the pawns;</i>

134
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:27,395
<i>if the pawn goes here
it'll cover this square;</i>

135
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,760
<i>this is good.</i>
So I moved the Knight -

136
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,515
I moved the King here,
because I want to prevent

137
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:37,775
the enemy King from
getting to the second rank,

138
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,705
and I like that I'm on this, like,
two-square diagonal move away from -

139
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:48,005
from the Knight, which means the Knight
will have to work very hard to check me,

140
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:51,155
and he moves his King there.

141
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,705
It might arguably in this position
have been better to move the King here,

142
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,889
because then it's not
in the way of the f-pawn.

143
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:05,599
The f-pawn is a more likely candidate
for promotion than the e-pawn is,

144
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:10,363
because the f1-square is a
light color, just like the Bishop,

145
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,999
whereas the e1
square is a dark color.

146
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:15,984
So it's easier for White to
blockade the dark square.

147
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:19,424
Of course, for the
f1-pawn to promote,

148
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:21,949
it has to get past the
f2-square, which is also dark,

149
00:10:21,974 --> 00:10:25,856
so these are the
squares that are very key;

150
00:10:27,824 --> 00:10:30,559
and this square, of course,
but that one I've gotten.

151
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:33,979
So anyway, I move the King
here, and he moves the King here,

152
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:37,969
and I push the Pawn -
okay, good, I'm blocking this -

153
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:44,782
He has this move,
forking the - the Bishop -

154
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:48,049
he has this move, forking
the Bishop and the Pawn,

155
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:51,564
but, like, I am totally willing

156
00:10:51,764 --> 00:10:54,109
to give away the
h-pawn in this position,

157
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:57,349
if it means that his Knight is going
to go all the way to h7 for it.

158
00:10:57,374 --> 00:11:01,464
Like, yeah! Great!
Do that! Please!

159
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:07,969
Uh, he's - he moves to Ke1.
He's got blockade ideas,

160
00:11:07,994 --> 00:11:10,129
and so now I have to
think of how I'm going to

161
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:13,489
advance this f-pawn. Like,
I would love to go here,

162
00:11:13,514 --> 00:11:19,159
but that drops the f-pawn with check, and
the Pawn can't advance if it's not there.

163
00:11:19,184 --> 00:11:22,459
So I reject that idea.
Instead, I go here,

164
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:27,439
and now I've got this move, and then I've
got this move coming, and it'll be check,

165
00:11:27,464 --> 00:11:32,509
and let's say he goes
here, then this will be mate,

166
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:36,229
or if he goes the other way,

167
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:38,900
then,

168
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:43,249
I can Queen!

169
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:46,129
So I'm liking this, I'm
liking this. He moves here.

170
00:11:46,154 --> 00:11:50,637
He's attacking my Bishop.

171
00:11:50,662 --> 00:11:52,339
More than just
attacking the Bishop:

172
00:11:52,364 --> 00:11:57,469
he is threatening
to go here, check,

173
00:11:57,494 --> 00:12:01,354
and that will attack my king
and it will attack my pawn.

174
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:05,634
And how do I protect my pawn

175
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,299
while not getting my King
taken? I have to go here,

176
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:11,509
and then I'm blocking
the Pawn again,

177
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:15,619
and now he has improved
his Knight's position.

178
00:12:15,644 --> 00:12:20,839
He's also threatening to
take the Pawn, but, again,

179
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:23,544
you can have that Pawn,
dude. Take the Pawn.

180
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:28,284
Get your Knight, like, opposite
side of the board. I'll Queen. Great.

181
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:41,082
And here I had to think
a lot, because - it's not -

182
00:12:41,114 --> 00:12:45,319
It's getting kind of crowded
over here if the Knight comes in,

183
00:12:45,344 --> 00:12:49,309
and maybe the Knight goes here; maybe
the Knight sacrifices itself for the Pawn;

184
00:12:49,334 --> 00:12:55,789
it's not clear to me that I
have a route to promote.

185
00:12:55,814 --> 00:13:01,249
And White's got some tricks with
that Knight and his crazy jumps.

186
00:13:01,274 --> 00:13:05,119
And so I thought, and I thought, and
I thought, and I came up with a very

187
00:13:05,144 --> 00:13:08,557
beautiful move. One
of my favorite moves.

188
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:13,339
It was a blitz game: we had
five minutes on the clock to start,

189
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:18,349
three minute increment after each move, but
I thought for thirty seconds on this move.

190
00:13:18,374 --> 00:13:24,316
So I'm gonna let YOU think, and see if
you come up with the same move that I did.

191
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:35,514
Okay? Here's what I did.

192
00:13:35,957 --> 00:13:40,783
Why is this such a good move?
And why did I have to think so long?

193
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:44,648
Okay, from a strategic point of view,

194
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:49,888
the Knight has two
ways to get back

195
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:53,184
and help his King
block the pawns.

196
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:57,047
I mean there's also this, but that's stick-
ing the Knight on the edge of the board,

197
00:13:57,071 --> 00:14:00,979
and the only way it can come in from there
there is this square, and that's covered,

198
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:03,410
so I'm not worried
about that so much;

199
00:14:05,947 --> 00:14:10,966
and this move just covers
both of those squares;

200
00:14:10,998 --> 00:14:12,705
and then I'm going to
advance the pawns,

201
00:14:12,729 --> 00:14:15,335
and advance the pawns, and
advance the pawns, and Queen.

202
00:14:17,804 --> 00:14:22,064
Also, this keeps eye on all of these pawns!
If any of these pawns advance, then that

203
00:14:22,064 --> 00:14:24,204
weakens the ones in front of it.

204
00:14:26,863 --> 00:14:31,783
I had to stop and think, because
what if he goes here check?

205
00:14:36,134 --> 00:14:38,177
<i>Well that's easy, Matt!
You moved the Bishop</i>

206
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:40,887
<i>there so you could
take him if he goes there!</i>

207
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:44,314
Yes but what happens if I take him?

208
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:47,674
Well, he takes back.

209
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,260
That's exactly what
he did. He checked me;

210
00:14:53,234 --> 00:14:55,220
and I took;

211
00:14:55,484 --> 00:14:57,464
and he takes back.

212
00:14:59,474 --> 00:15:00,619
And now what?

213
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:04,369
I had to calculate,
all the way back here,

214
00:15:04,394 --> 00:15:06,409
I had to calculate
what would happen

215
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:10,189
if I moved the Bishop, and he checked
me, and then I took, and he took back:

216
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:14,055
and I saw that he had a
Pawn here, and he could go

217
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,257
one - two - three -
and get a Queen;

218
00:15:20,774 --> 00:15:24,709
but I went for the move anyway,
because I saw that what my King could do,

219
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:27,767
and my pawns against his King,

220
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:32,940
was even better than a Queen,
and I'll show you what that was.

221
00:15:33,464 --> 00:15:35,820
He checks; I take;
he takes back.

222
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:41,523
So the f-pawn is the key.
We push the f-pawn forward.

223
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:44,232
Well what's he gonna
do? He's gonna Queen.

224
00:15:44,264 --> 00:15:47,000
This is - this guy here - this
White Pawn - this is like the White -

225
00:15:47,024 --> 00:15:49,759
the wide receiver in football,

226
00:15:49,784 --> 00:15:54,380
who has just blasted past the safety,
and he's waiting for the ball to come

227
00:15:54,405 --> 00:15:57,431
and he reaches up his hands,
and the ball falls into his hands,

228
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,674
and he's running, and then he's going to
the end zone, and there's nobody between

229
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:03,716
him and the end zone, and
he's going to get a touchdown.

230
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:06,852
What's going on here?

231
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:09,864
This guy - this is like -

232
00:16:10,634 --> 00:16:13,429
the quarterback is
on the one yard line;

233
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:15,559
and he gets the
ball from the center;

234
00:16:15,584 --> 00:16:19,489
and the center pushes; and the
guard next to the center pushes;

235
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:24,756
and there's this defensive
tackle - defensive end;

236
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,894
and they're trying to stop the quarterback
from going over the one yard line and they

237
00:16:29,894 --> 00:16:33,374
just push, and they
shove, and they get over.

238
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:38,536
And who wins? Who's
gonna make it to the end zone?

239
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,656
And who wins the
game? Let's see!

240
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,720
So I pushed, with check.

241
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:52,000
Interestingly, White has two moves
here. I only considered one.

242
00:16:53,624 --> 00:16:56,504
I only considered this one which is the
move that was played in the game,

243
00:16:56,504 --> 00:16:59,690
but the computer finds this move too

244
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:04,656
Like, maybe I instinctively
ignored it because I saw I could Queen;

245
00:17:04,694 --> 00:17:07,369
and then once you get the
Queen the Queen is with check;

246
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:10,819
and then you can just go all the
way back down here and blockade;

247
00:17:10,844 --> 00:17:14,179
and then you can Queen another
Queen; and you can round up

248
00:17:14,204 --> 00:17:18,379
this pawn; and you can round up all
these other pawns; and then you can get

249
00:17:18,411 --> 00:17:23,911
five Queens, total; and I should be
able to checkmate them with five Queens.

250
00:17:24,494 --> 00:17:29,989
But it is all irrelevant, because
he actually moved to f1.

251
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:32,449
<i>But what are you gonna
do about this Pawn, Matt?</i>

252
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,413
<i>Your King can't race back!</i>

253
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:39,808
I move here.
Very simple.

254
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:45,557
Now at this point you're probably
thinking <i>I begin to believe.</i>

255
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:50,983
Okay, so he comes
forward; and I go forward;

256
00:17:53,594 --> 00:17:59,103
and he Queens! He gets a Queen! Oh
no! It's a Pawn endgame! He has a Queen!

257
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:04,969
And I checkmate. That's mate.

258
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:09,300
White King is in check. White King
can't go here because of the Pawn.

259
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:13,512
White King can't go
here because of the Pawn.

260
00:18:13,537 --> 00:18:16,992
Black King covers
these three squares.

261
00:18:17,024 --> 00:18:19,951
Beautiful checkmate pattern.

262
00:18:19,976 --> 00:18:24,259
And that is the story
how, in a Pawn endgame,

263
00:18:24,284 --> 00:18:30,090
I allowed my opponent
to Queen; I did not Queen;

264
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:35,983
and I won! Thanks for watching.
