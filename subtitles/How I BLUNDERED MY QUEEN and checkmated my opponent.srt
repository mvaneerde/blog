1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,980
Hey! We're going to take a
look that a game I just played,

2
00:00:05,946 --> 00:00:08,796
where I made a mouseslip and I
blundered my queen;

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,470
and yet, I ended up
checkmating my opponent.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,720
So it starts out as a
nice Queen's Gambit.

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,988
This is a blitz game: we
started with five minutes each

6
00:00:22,013 --> 00:00:24,410
and we get a three minute
increment for each move.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,503
[We] play this very natural opening
he plays the Albin Counter Gambit,

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:35,285
which is technically a bit
dubious, but very very playable

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,630
in a blitz setting.

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,845
The best move here is
for White to take the Pawn;

11
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,665
I did not take the Pawn,
because I was afraid of the

12
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:46,595
tactical complications that would ensue.
Instead I played the very quiet move

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,701
e3, and then we just play chess.

14
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,555
So he checks me; I block with
the Bishop; he takes; I take.

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,540
I liked the exchange because it
gives me a free developing move.

16
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,350
He does not take the Pawn;
instead he plays ... d6.

17
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,810
I develop my Bishop,
and he trades the Pawn.

18
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,223
He checks me. Again, free
development for me: I'll take it.

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,844
And at this point, he
brings out his Bishops.

20
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:19,020
And now he's going for the attack,
even though it's not really justified.

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,490
He's trying to pile
up on my Knight here.

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,755
He's got it pinned
against the Queen,

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,933
and he also has a pin against
the King; but I just castle,

24
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:32,580
and I'm gonna bring
a Rook to the center;

25
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,927
and his Queen's going to
be in some trouble,

26
00:01:36,952 --> 00:01:38,513
pinned against the King.

27
00:01:38,538 --> 00:01:40,300
And so, I like my position here.

28
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,018
He takes I take back.

29
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:46,900
And now he makes a big
mistake. He had to castle.

30
00:01:48,836 --> 00:01:53,042
He had to get out of
the center with his King.

31
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:00,515
What he's done now is, he's allowed
me the chance of exploiting this

32
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,725
tactic where I go after his
King, and his Queen's in the way;

33
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:08,229
but, but, first to
prepare it I do Bf3,

34
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:11,073
and that puts an
attack on the b-pawn.

35
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,839
So I'm threatening to pin
his Queen; I'm threatening his

36
00:02:14,864 --> 00:02:22,225
b-pawn; the only move which
protects both is to castle long.

37
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,256
Uh, this is not the best move.

38
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,835
So now I've got some extra space on the
queen side because my pawns are advanced;

39
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,393
I've got the Bishop already
trained on the Queenside;

40
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:37,170
my Knight and my Queen
can easily get there; I can

41
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,865
push the a-pawn; this is all
playing out very well for me.

42
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:46,499
But before I do that I moved the Rook to
e1. Why? Because when I moved the Rook

43
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:50,130
to e1, his Queen is under attack, and
there's only one way to save it: and

44
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:52,060
that's to move the Queen back.

45
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,475
And this is improving the
position of my Rook, and

46
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,195
"de-improving" the position of
his Queen. So that's what I did.

47
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,815
Then I bring out the Queen, and
I'm piling up on this pawn here,

48
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,981
threatening mate.

49
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:14,195
He's forced to weaken his - I say

50
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,215
"Kingside." It's not really the
Kingside; it's the side where his King is,

51
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,565
which is the Queenside.

52
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,370
So he's weakening the pawns in front of his
King. He pushes: he could push either the

53
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,145
b-pawn or the c-pawn.

54
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,855
He chooses the b-pawn. The
c-pawn would have been better,

55
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,565
because if you push the b-pawn,
now we've got these light-squared -

56
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,383
Queen's going to come
in on the light squares,

57
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:41,315
this way; and the
only way he can

58
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,854
protect the light squares is with his
Knight. But the Knight can't go here

59
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,107
because of the pawn, and
it's just not looking good at all.

60
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:54,005
So I go here. He does ... a5.

61
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,990
Worse and worse.

62
00:03:56,015 --> 00:04:01,625
Now his pawns are very far
advanced, and he just comes in.

63
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,795
Can't stop it, and he goes Nb8.

64
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:12,305
At this point I felt like
I was really doing well.

65
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,755
I don't see an
immediate checkmate,

66
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,875
But this Queenside
attack is so strong.

67
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,775
The Queen's gonna infiltrate;

68
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,207
the King's going
to have to go here;

69
00:04:25,232 --> 00:04:27,252
I going to bring out the Rooks;

70
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:31,282
I'm going to firebomb his
pawns; they're all going to blow up;

71
00:04:31,307 --> 00:04:35,675
he's going to have an open
King; his Rook is nowhere;

72
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,480
his Queen is almost nowhere.
It's just really looking bad for him.

73
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,645
So I went to make this move,

74
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:49,055
and maybe my trackpad was
miscalibrated; maybe I was so excited;

75
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,725
whatever reason; instead of making
this move I ended up accidentally making...

76
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,255
THIS move;

77
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,356
which is probably the
WORST move in the position.

78
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,682
Oh no. As soon as I saw this
move on the board I said to myself:

79
00:05:04,707 --> 00:05:08,192
<i>No, that is not the move I meant to play</i>
and I press the little button that says

80
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:15,215
<i>Dear opponent: please
let me take back my move.</i>

81
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,245
Takebacks are
not well thought of.

82
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:21,450
It can be abused: you make a move; you look
at the position; you don't like it; you say

83
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:24,126
<i>No, no, no, I'm going to do this other
move instead please let me take back</i>

84
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,778
and then you end up with
a game that never ends.

85
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,169
But this case it was obvious
that I meant to do Qb7.

86
00:05:33,194 --> 00:05:34,953
It's the only move
that makes any sense

87
00:05:34,977 --> 00:05:37,642
that could possibly have
mouse-slipped to this,

88
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,425
and my opponent said <i>No</i>.

89
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,903
I don't fault my opponent for this. I would
have done the same thing in his situation.

90
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,975
We're playing a blitz game.

91
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,582
This is a rated
game, and in blitz,

92
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,037
mistakes are part of the game.
You're going to make mistakes.

93
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,145
So he very properly
declines the takeback,

94
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,520
and (given that he declines
the takeback) he has to move.

95
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:03,185
There's only one
move he legally has.

96
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,465
He has to deal with this check.

97
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,956
The only way to deal with
the check is to take the Queen.

98
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,815
Now he's up a Queen.

99
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,037
So I've gone from the
computer saying <i>+11.3</i>,

100
00:06:18,847 --> 00:06:20,435
because of Qb7+,

101
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,304
to <i>-9.4</i>. I've lost twenty
points of material.

102
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,211
Two Queens.

103
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:32,178
I've gone from being effectively a
Queen up, to being a Queen down.

104
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,955
And so I'm here. In this
move the only rational move -

105
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,165
In this POSITION the only
rational move is to resign.

106
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,789
Your down a Queen.

107
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,161
He - Black's going to
get his pieces in order.

108
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,486
He's going to finish - the - he's going
to have to develop his Queen somehow.

109
00:06:56,222 --> 00:07:01,475
Uh, there's no prayer of a draw.

110
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,025
Certainly no way to win.

111
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,574
But I'm not thinking rationally.
I've just blundered my queen,

112
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,759
due to a mouseslip;

113
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:12,892
I've asked for takeback;
I've been refused;

114
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,445
I'm not thinking <i>okay
let's - let's accept</i>

115
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,689
<i>the loss, and resign, and
move on, and play a new game.</i>

116
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:22,466
I said <i>no, I'm
gonna keep playing.</i>

117
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:27,935
<i>I'm going to play a few moves and then
maybe get a check or two;</i>

118
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,502
<i>and THEN I'll resign.</i>

119
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:37,625
So what do I do? I play c5.

120
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:40,861
If I'm going to get a check with my
pieces that are all the way back here,

121
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:42,741
then I need to get these
pawns out of the way.

122
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,705
So I sacrifice a pawn. He
takes; I take back -

123
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,665
I DON'T take back.
I bring in the Knight.

124
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,121
<i>If you want this pawn, sir,
go ahead and take it:</i>

125
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:03,365
<i>and that'll give me the open
file against your King.</i>

126
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,602
He correctly ignores my
suggestion to take with the pawn,

127
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:09,254
and he takes with
the Rook instead.

128
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:13,835
I go here. I get the half-open
file, and I'm like <i>all right:</i>

129
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,021
<i>somehow I'm going to get this c-pawn
out of the way.</i>

130
00:08:16,046 --> 00:08:18,785
<i>I don't know HOW I'm going to do it, yet.</i>

131
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,385
<i>But I'm going to do it. That's what I'm
going to do. I'm going to get your King.</i>

132
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,925
<i>Somehow, sir.</i>

133
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,195
He develops his Knight;

134
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,915
reinforces this pawn;
and he's doing good, here.

135
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,755
a3. What's the idea of
a3? I want to push b4!

136
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,390
If I push b4 right away, he
just takes with the a-pawn.

137
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:45,875
... g5. What? He is quite properly
ignoring my attack on the Queenside,

138
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,645
which is doomed to failure,

139
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,850
and he says <i>what am I gonna
do? I need to develop my Queen,</i>

140
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,765
<i>and my Rook, so I'm gonna
push these pawns in front of them:</i>

141
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,780
<i>and then not only am I developing
my Queen, and my Rook,</i>

142
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:59,045
<i>I'm also attacking your King.</i>

143
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:03,156
When you're up a Queen, what do
you do you? You try to end the game.

144
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:06,155
Okay. I push b4.

145
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,135
He takes. I take.

146
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,238
He pushes ... g4.

147
00:09:11,263 --> 00:09:15,473
Kingside attack! <i>You're not the
only one that can attack, Matt.</i>

148
00:09:15,498 --> 00:09:18,602
Now my Bishop's under attack, and I have to
be very careful what I do here,

149
00:09:18,627 --> 00:09:21,826
because when I'm -
when you're down,

150
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:23,493
you need to keep your
pieces on the board.

151
00:09:23,518 --> 00:09:26,526
If you let your pieces
be traded off the board,

152
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:32,902
then any hope you may
have evaporates in smoke.

153
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:38,255
That is to say the <i>trade
offer</i> is a powerful weapon,

154
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,885
in the hands of the person
who is ahead in material.

155
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,945
So, I retreat,

156
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,438
and he brings out
his Knight further.

157
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:49,875
He's going to go here; he's
going to attack my Bishop;

158
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:55,870
he's going to soften up the g-pawn;
he's going to just take the pawn.

159
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,140
He's got all kinds of
good stuff going on here.

160
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:01,159
I don't want my pawn to
be taken, so I'm like <i>all right,</i>

161
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:04,096
<i>this pawn's going to die
but he's going to give his all.</i>

162
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:07,207
<i>He's going to
take out this pawn,</i>

163
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:12,787
<i>which is supporting this pawn, which is
covering the King, so I'm going to take it.</i>

164
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:15,812
And I'm thinking <i>he's going to take back
here</i>. He doesn't do that. He takes with the

165
00:10:15,812 --> 00:10:18,277
Knight instead.
This is perfectly fine.

166
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:19,867
Perfectly fine move.

167
00:10:19,892 --> 00:10:24,320
It does mean though, that are no pawns
covering his King anymore.

168
00:10:24,345 --> 00:10:30,187
He might have to deal with the
fact that, after I move my Knight,

169
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:35,355
his Knight is completely pinned against
the King, and it cannot move at all.

170
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,621
So that's what I do. I'm
like <i>all right, I'm gonna go</i>

171
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:41,197
<i>pile up on this pawn
that you pushed,</i>

172
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:44,647
<i>and I'm gonna realize this pin
I'm pinning against your King.</i>

173
00:10:44,672 --> 00:10:47,497
He says, <i>all right, I'm
going to protect my pawn;</i>

174
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:49,747
<i>and by the way I'm going
to attack your Knight;</i>

175
00:10:49,772 --> 00:10:54,187
<i>and I'm going to get my Queen developed;
and maybe I'll slide a Rook behind it;</i>

176
00:10:54,212 --> 00:10:57,727
<i>and I'm coming for you, Matt.</i>

177
00:10:57,752 --> 00:11:02,888
So, I play this Bishop move, because
I don't want my Knight to be destroyed.

178
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,557
Remember what I said:
<i>if you're down material</i>

179
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,778
<i>you want to keep what
pieces you have on the board,</i>

180
00:11:07,802 --> 00:11:10,345
<i>and hope, and
pray, for a miracle.</i>

181
00:11:11,552 --> 00:11:15,158
He brings his Knight over here.

182
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:20,227
The Bishop isn't there anymore, but
the pawn is. So he's threatening my King,

183
00:11:20,252 --> 00:11:24,907
and i'm really worried
about this Knight fork.

184
00:11:24,932 --> 00:11:27,427
You can't play the
Knight fork right away.

185
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:29,797
It LOOKS like you
can, because I've got

186
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:32,377
one,

187
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:35,167
two attackers on that square;

188
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:38,497
and he's got

189
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:40,799
the Rook defending it, and
the other Knight defending it;

190
00:11:40,823 --> 00:11:44,977
but remember this Knight is not
REALLY defending, because of this pin.

191
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:50,306
So if he were to move the Knight fork
work right away, then I would just take.

192
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:55,267
It would be a free Knight.

193
00:11:55,292 --> 00:12:00,415
But still, it's a concern. So I
move - I move my Rook here.

194
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:04,321
This stops the Knight fork for good
and all, because you're only attacking

195
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:06,907
one Rook; and I can
just move the Rook.

196
00:12:06,932 --> 00:12:11,707
And also it brings in the idea of maybe -
maybe I double up the Rooks on the

197
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:15,170
c-file; or maybe I bring the Rook
over here, and add another attacker

198
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:17,557
to the b-pawn - to the g-pawn:

199
00:12:17,582 --> 00:12:19,957
I'm activating my Rooks.

200
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:22,802
He plays ... f6. he's like <i>all right, you
need to make a decision about what you're</i>

201
00:12:22,802 --> 00:12:25,477
<i>doing with this
Knight. Right now.</i>

202
00:12:25,502 --> 00:12:28,567
<i>If you're going to take the
pawn, this is your last chance.</i>

203
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:31,011
Well I CAN'T take the
pawn. So I'm like, <i>all right,</i>

204
00:12:31,036 --> 00:12:35,077
<i>I can't - I don't want to
go here. I can't go here.</i>

205
00:12:35,102 --> 00:12:37,082
<i>I can't go here.</i>

206
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:40,335
Well, I guess I could, but
then I'd be trading off my Knight.

207
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,697
<i>I - I could go here.
I could actually go here.</i>

208
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:48,116
<i>No, then he takes with the
Rook; then I take the Rook;</i>

209
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,045
<i>and then he takes
with the Queen.</i>

210
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:54,847
<i>Okay. So really the only sensible
square for my Knight to go was here.</i>

211
00:12:54,872 --> 00:12:59,857
<i>It's not really attacking the King;
it's just kind of cozying up to him;</i>

212
00:12:59,882 --> 00:13:03,434
<i>but it does attack the
Rook. So, alright, I'll go -</i>

213
00:13:05,132 --> 00:13:08,312
<i>I'll go here, I get a
tempo on the Rook.</i>

214
00:13:09,782 --> 00:13:13,210
And here he says - I dunno if he
missed that I was attacking his Rook,

215
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:17,497
or he was like <i>you know I'm willing
to sacrifice the Rook to get this move.</i>

216
00:13:17,522 --> 00:13:21,212
He pushes the h-pawn; and he's gonna bring
in the h-pawn; and the g-pawn; he's got the

217
00:13:21,212 --> 00:13:24,877
Knight; he's got the Queen; he's got
the Rook. He's going after my King

218
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:28,173
with almost everything he's got.

219
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:32,227
Now I'm going to take that Rook!
Yes, sir! Now I'm only down a Rook;

220
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:34,807
and, by the way, this

221
00:13:34,832 --> 00:13:39,068
check would pick up the Queen - if this
Knight wasn't here. Because this Knight.

222
00:13:39,093 --> 00:13:44,077
Is pinned. So I'm - in the back
of my mind I got this g3 threat;

223
00:13:44,102 --> 00:13:47,006
force the Knight to
move; win the Queen!

224
00:13:49,082 --> 00:13:51,929
He plays ... h4.

225
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:55,858
He's like, <i>all right, you push
the g3, and I'll trade it off.</i>

226
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:59,438
And that's what I did. He takes.

227
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,677
Now, I have to think here:
because if I take with the h-pawn,

228
00:14:02,702 --> 00:14:07,027
then this h1-square is extremely
weak. The Queen moves over here:

229
00:14:07,052 --> 00:14:09,797
no more fork;
threatening mate on h1;

230
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:12,037
I have no way - good -
good way to defend it.

231
00:14:12,062 --> 00:14:16,327
So no. We're going to take
with f-pawn instead. That way,

232
00:14:16,352 --> 00:14:22,770
when he moves the Queen
over here, I can defend laterally;

233
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:27,577
(I can't defend with the other
Rook, because the Knight will take it;)

234
00:14:27,602 --> 00:14:30,877
and then the
Knight has to retreat;

235
00:14:30,902 --> 00:14:33,907
and I get the check on the
King. I don't win the Queen,

236
00:14:33,932 --> 00:14:38,855
but, hey, at least my attack
has some excuse of merit.

237
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,007
Like, <i>well, okay I lost a Queen, but I
got a check on you before I lost.</i> Okay.

238
00:14:45,032 --> 00:14:51,018
And he makes a huge mistake. This
throws away his win. This is now a draw.

239
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,937
Why? I mean, he's
threatening mate, right?

240
00:14:58,382 --> 00:15:01,589
And this attack isn't real,
'cause the Knight covers it;

241
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:04,973
and I can't take the Knight
cause of the mate threat:

242
00:15:06,512 --> 00:15:11,652
it just checks, and he mates me on the
back ranks with his Queen and his Rook.

243
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:15,925
Uh, the reason this loses -

244
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:19,442
or, it doesn't lose - the reason
this throws away the win -

245
00:15:19,869 --> 00:15:21,968
what should he have done?
He should have gone here.

246
00:15:21,992 --> 00:15:23,733
This is a much better move.
What's the difference between

247
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,952
this square and this square?

248
00:15:26,702 --> 00:15:32,977
So, I think he was trying
to move the Queen away

249
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:36,427
trom the threat of attack,

250
00:15:36,452 --> 00:15:40,096
and he was worried about me
putting my Knight back there,

251
00:15:40,121 --> 00:15:43,027
and getting this check between
the Queen and the Rook -

252
00:15:43,052 --> 00:15:45,522
between the - between
the Queen and the King.

253
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:55,087
But if he moves here, then I don't
have this move right away. I have to

254
00:15:55,112 --> 00:15:57,247
take a move, and
support it somehow,

255
00:15:57,272 --> 00:16:00,018
and it's very difficult to find
time with the attack on the King;

256
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,667
but with the move he played,

257
00:16:03,692 --> 00:16:06,157
I can just make this
move right away;

258
00:16:06,182 --> 00:16:09,736
and that is checking the King,
and now the King is in trouble.

259
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,723
If he tries to come forward,

260
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:22,303
then I have the check
here, and I win the Queen.

261
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:26,015
(Incidentally that
protects the Rook as well.)

262
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:31,943
So he has to go back.

263
00:16:33,512 --> 00:16:36,311
And if he goes back here -

264
00:16:37,772 --> 00:16:41,025
I don't know what happens. What
happens if he goes back there?

265
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:44,303
Then it's mate in
three. I get the check,

266
00:16:44,852 --> 00:16:50,930
he has to go here,
and then he gets mated;

267
00:16:52,652 --> 00:16:57,676
or he has to go here, and then
he gets mated the other way.

268
00:17:04,716 --> 00:17:09,683
And why can't he just take the Bishop
with the Knight? Because it's pinned.

269
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:16,177
Anyway, so he can't go straight back. He
has to go back to one of the dark squares.

270
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,392
He goes back here.

271
00:17:18,452 --> 00:17:22,417
And now I see that I have the
draw and I'm like <i>wow! I can't believe</i>

272
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,837
<i>I got away with a
draw in this game!</i>

273
00:17:25,862 --> 00:17:28,990
So I move here,
check. He goes there,

274
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:32,216
and I'm toying with the idea of
<i>okay I'll go here and check him,</i>

275
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,267
<i>and then he can go
either here, or here:</i>

276
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:37,567
<i>whichever way he
goes I check him again;</i>

277
00:17:37,592 --> 00:17:40,837
<i>and he has to go
back, whichever way;</i>

278
00:17:40,862 --> 00:17:45,157
<i>and then I check him on a7 again,
and we just shuffle back and forth;</i>

279
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:47,077
<i>until we get the
three move repetition.</i>

280
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:49,208
But then I thought: <i>eh,</i>

281
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:52,620
<i>I'm gonna throw a little fear of
God into him. He must be rattled:</i>

282
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:55,837
<i>he's just thrown away the
win; he's got a draw. I'm gonna</i>

283
00:17:55,862 --> 00:17:59,383
<i>scare him a little. I'm
gonna make this check, here.</i>

284
00:17:59,432 --> 00:18:02,947
And he can take it with
the Knight: that's fine.

285
00:18:02,972 --> 00:18:06,365
The Knight doesn't interfere
with my perpetual plan.

286
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:12,937
And also now, when I do
the move to a7, there's a

287
00:18:12,962 --> 00:18:15,115
double-check instead of a check.

288
00:18:16,292 --> 00:18:21,023
And it's not actually any better,
but it adds that level of fear -

289
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:23,216
that psychological
dimension to it.

290
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:27,122
'Cause remember you're not playing against
a computer! You're playing against another

291
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:32,229
human being; and human beings are psycho-
logical creatures; and they have fear.

292
00:18:32,254 --> 00:18:33,997
So, I make this check.

293
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:36,518
He is forced to take:
that is the only legal move;

294
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:40,202
then I play the Na7+. Here he can
go left, or he can go right; it doesn't

295
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,895
matter; and he goes left.

296
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:48,043
A check: two legal moves here.

297
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:52,712
If he goes back to Kc8, he's walking
into that discovered check; actually,

298
00:18:52,712 --> 00:18:54,037
it's a double check;

299
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:57,664
and he has to calculate <i>okay,
what if Knight goes here, or if Knight goes</i>

300
00:18:57,689 --> 00:19:01,475
<i>here? Is there any kind of fork
situation that I have to worry about?</i>

301
00:19:02,612 --> 00:19:09,263
There isn't, but he decides to play
it safe, and he goes in the corner;

302
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:16,496
which gives me checkmate.

303
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:20,336
So I win.

304
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:30,066
Crazy game. That is the story

305
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:33,143
of how I mouseslipped a Queen,

306
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,516
and ended up checkmating.

307
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,436
Okay, thanks for watching!
