Hello Youtube! I recently, after
many unsuccessful attempts,

2
00:00:07,721 --> 00:00:12,845
was able to get 50
puzzles correct in a row

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,685
on the lichess.org
"Puzzle Streak" feature.

4
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,685
If you would like to
play along with me,

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:27,936
I have freeze-framed
the first, and the last,

6
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:33,299
little bits of each
puzzle. Good luck!

7
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,151
(Ravel's <i>Bolero</i> plays throughout)

8
00:00:38,209 --> 00:00:39,723
(no audible dialogue throughout)

9
00:11:00,854 --> 00:11:03,273
(<i>Bolero</i> ends; no
audible dialogue)
