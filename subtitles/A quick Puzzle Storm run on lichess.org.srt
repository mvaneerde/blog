1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,705
This is a test of the - I'm going to do a

2
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,750
quick Puzzle Storm on lichess.

3
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:26,303
Okay.

4
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,830
Take the Rook; take the Rook.

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,803
Check, pick up the Rook.

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,616
Fork; pick up the Queen.

7
00:00:37,763 --> 00:00:38,817
Hmm.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,740
Trade off the Rook and get the
Pawn promoted; checkmate.

9
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:47,976
Doot-doot-doo; tricky.

10
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,043
Hmm.

11
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,670
I don't see what this one is.

12
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,389
So, just pick up
the Knight? Yes.

13
00:00:55,646 --> 00:00:57,936
The other Knight was
hanging, if the King retreated.

14
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:00,403
Okay, mate in two.

15
00:01:01,296 --> 00:01:04,923
Um... pick up the Rook, thank you.

16
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,190
Other one of these Queen forks.

17
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,216
Um... my Queen's under
attack; his Queen's under attack;

18
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:13,450
but I get the Knight! So, we'll trade.

19
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,410
Okay, free Rook, thank you.
What kind of puzzle is that?

20
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:21,110
Uh, push the King away
from the Rook; then it's free.

21
00:01:22,496 --> 00:01:23,670
Uh, mate in one.

22
00:01:24,929 --> 00:01:27,965
Doot-doot-doo; I can take the pawn,

23
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,785
make - the Rook falls,

24
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,430
and take the Rook. Sweet.

25
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:37,960
Uh, check, cover the guard
square, and mate. Cool.

26
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,326
The e7 square was critical there.

27
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,580
Uh...

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,521
I think this is just a free Bishop
because the Knight is pinned?

29
00:01:50,545 --> 00:01:53,586
Nope! I don't know what that
one was. I will look at that one later.

30
00:01:55,373 --> 00:01:59,890
Hmm. I take the Knight,
and the Rook falls? Yes.

31
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:04,023
Okay, this is just a
mate down the back rank.

32
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,990
Um... pick up the Queen.

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,933
Pick up the Bishop for free.

34
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:16,990
Doot-doot-doo; check.

35
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,346
Now, if I take the Rook,
he gets the other Rook.

36
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,866
So what do I do here?

37
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,220
I just take THIS Rook, and
then I'm up a piece. Okay

38
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:32,040
The - remove the guard with
check, and I pick up the Queen.

39
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,740
Hmm.

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,095
Like, I trade off the Queens;
and then I take the Bishop.

41
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,050
Nope! I'm in check. Okay.

42
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:48,790
I take the Bishop? It's free?
And THEN I exchange Queens? Cool.

43
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:53,710
Uh... we move the piece out of the
way, and take the Bishop with mate.

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,123
Um... King gets mated.

45
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:03,624
See, the Rook hangs. I go here, check; and
then check; and then the Rook. Thank you.

46
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:12,340
Doot-doot-doo... okay, remove the
guard from the Queen. Thank you.

47
00:03:13,736 --> 00:03:15,550
Check and free Queen.

48
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:24,232
Hmm. Kill the Bishop, and
then the Pawn promotes.

49
00:03:26,403 --> 00:03:30,697
Ooo! Ooo!

50
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,596
Nice.

51
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:37,870
La-la-la - trapped Queen.

52
00:03:40,876 --> 00:03:44,662
Uh... I have to kick the Pawn out of
the way, and then this Pawn promotes.

53
00:03:46,496 --> 00:03:49,840
Mmmm... this one's not so easy.

54
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,416
Take the Rook, and
then the Queen. Okay.

55
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:59,416
Now, to take the Knight
first; and then the Rook falls.

56
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:00,916
Oops.

57
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:04,089
Let's look at the
mistakes I made.

58
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,910
Okay. So, the Queen's
under attack, is the first thing.

59
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,413
So, I think this is just a free
Bishop. I'm going to take the Bishop.

60
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,769
That was it. That is it!

61
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,770
Let's go back here.

62
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:30,091
Okay, this one I thought I actually
got, and I just ran out of time.

63
00:04:30,115 --> 00:04:34,145
You take the Knight,
which attacks the Queen;

64
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,384
and then you fork the
Queen and the King;

65
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:42,022
and he moves the King; and then
you can bring your Rook out of attack;

66
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,125
and that's it! Okay!

67
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,609
This concludes the test of
the Facebook Live feature.
