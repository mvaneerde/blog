1
00:00:02,954 --> 00:00:04,621
(exhales) Nice.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,455
Bishop endgame.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,424
I love endgames, chat: I may
have mentioned that before.

4
00:00:17,243 --> 00:00:20,580
Um... just push?

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,020
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 pawns for Black; 1, 2, 3,
4, 5 pawns for White. I love this little

6
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:26,640
formation here.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,710
Like normally this is very weak,

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,881
but the fact that they're all
on light squares, and

9
00:00:33,906 --> 00:00:38,045
our Bishop is on dark
squares means that, like,

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,327
It's actually,
paradoxically, quite strong.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,547
And it's tempting to
suggest - oops. OH NO!

12
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,760
I meant to demonstrate
why that was the

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,195
wrong move, and I accidentally
made that move! Nooo!

14
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,335
Okay.

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,873
What is the real move here, chat?
The real move here is ... h2. Yes.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,385
I was going to
come around to that.

17
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,190
Aargh... fail.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,910
I failed, chat. I'm sorry.

19
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,450
I failed you all.

20
00:01:13,493 --> 00:01:15,789
I'm a bad streamer.
I let my chat down.

21
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,329
Okay.

22
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:32,143
Anyway I was going to
demonstrate - let's analyze.

23
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:45,263
Okay.

24
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,910
Where is the analyze
button? There it is.

25
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,270
Okay. Anyway
chat, as I was saying,

26
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,395
Like it's tempting to
push this pawn, and then

27
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,185
a key sacrifice to allow this
pawn to push. But then this

28
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,399
pawn behind it covers.

29
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,596
So it's a strong
defensive formation.

30
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,524
But anyway, the idea of the
puzzle is to push the pawn...

31
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:24,549
where were we...

32
00:02:24,574 --> 00:02:27,155
here. Okay. So,
we push the pawn.

33
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,717
If White takes, then you
just get the Bishop for free;

34
00:02:31,742 --> 00:02:35,615
and, um... if White

35
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,675
moves his King here, then
you just take the Bishop anyway;

36
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,776
and the King cannot take
because then you promote.

37
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,570
So this is actually a
trap to win the Bishop,

38
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,519
by overloading the King.

39
00:02:52,593 --> 00:02:54,006
Oh. man.

40
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:57,746
Aargh, it's depressing.

41
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,723
Aargh, mouseslip.

42
00:03:08,883 --> 00:03:10,270
(exhales)

43
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:16,536
(exhales)

44
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,286
Okay! We start over.
